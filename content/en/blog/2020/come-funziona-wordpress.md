You followed the guide to [configure your PC for web development](/en/blog/setting-up-the-pc-for-wordpress-development/), understood [how a local server works](/en/blog/why-install-wordpress-locally/), and [installed a copy of WordPress](/en/blog/install-wordpress-locally/) on your computer, **now what?**

Now, **let's understand how WordPress works!**

Explaining everything about WordPress in a single article is unthinkable... The possibilities that the CMS offers are too many...

[![](/images/free-download-desk.jpg)](/free-resources/)

But today, we will see **the main things**, lay the **foundations** to build our skills with WordPress!

In this article, I will teach you **specifically**:

- how WordPress handles content
- how to create Articles and Pages

## ACCESSING THE BACKEND

Now that you have [installed your WordPress site locally](/en/blog/install-wordpress-locally/), let's understand how to enter the **backend**.

After [starting **Apache** and **MySQL** from **XAMPP**](/en/blog/how-does-xampp-work/), open the **browser** and type "localhost/" + the name of your site.

If you followed the previous lesson, you should type: [http://localhost/wp-test/](http://localhost/wp-test/)

You should see the **home page** of the standard **WordPress** site.

Now to enter the backend, go to the **URL bar** and **add** "wp-admin".

**The final URL** will then be this: [http://localhost/wp-test/wp-admin/](http://localhost/wp-test/wp-admin/)

At this point, we find ourselves on the WordPress **login** screen.

**Enter** your credentials and log in.

Here is the **WordPress backend**. From here, you can **manage** all the content on your website.

## GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE BACKEND

But **how does** this backend work?

It's very **simple**. On the left, you will find all the sections to configure your site, while on the right, you will see what you are currently editing.

Take some time to **scroll through all the items in the sidebar menu** of the backend to get a general idea of how it works.

## 1. CONTENT MANAGEMENT

Now let's understand how **content is managed in WordPress**.

When we create a new page for our site, we can choose between **two possibilities:**

- **Articles**
- **Pages**

### ARTICLES

**Articles** are content listed in reverse chronological order (from newest to oldest). They are used for **blogs**, newspapers, and all sites that are constantly updated.

**Articles** can be divided into **categories** and can contain **tags**. This makes them easily traceable by users.

They also encourage conversation through the presence of **comments** at the bottom.

An **example** of an Article is what you are reading now!

### PAGES

WordPress **Pages** are standalone pieces of content, one-time, without particular relationships with other site content. An example of a **Page** is the site's contact page or the "about us" page. This type of content usually does not have a comments section.

Both of these types can contain **text**, images, **links**, and anything else you may want to include in your **content**.

### MEDIA

![](/images/image-25.png)

If you took a look at the WordPress backend sidebar, right between **Articles** and **Pages**, you will find the **Media** section.

This section gathers **all the resources** you will upload to your site, such as photos, images, pdfs, etc...

## 2. GRAPHICS MANAGEMENT

The graphic part of your site is managed through the **"Appearance"** section.

Within this section, you can find:

- **Themes:** It is the "clothing" of your site, what surrounds your content. In simpler terms, the graphics. Through this section, you can search and install new themes for your site.
- **Customize:** This section allows you to customize the installed theme. Some themes have more customizations than others.
- **Widgets:** Widgets are blocks that perform a specific action (such as a list or a menu) and can be added to a specific location on the site, like the sidebar.
- **Menu:** It allows you to create and modify the menus on your website. An example of a menu is usually the site's navbar, which allows you to navigate and find desired content.
- **Background:** It allows you to change the site's background. This item is linked to the default WordPress theme; if you install a new theme, it might disappear.
- **Theme Editor:** Allows you to edit the style sheet of the theme. Here, things get interesting. If you try to open it, you will see

 a sheet written in CSS language. If you continue to follow this site, you will learn how to navigate easily through these types of files.

## 3. FUNCTIONALITY MANAGEMENT

All the features you want to implement on your site can be found in the **"Plugins"** section.

Plugins are **small software** that allow the site to perform a **specific function**.

For example, if you want to add a **contact form** to your site, you can look for a plugin that handles this function.

There are **thousands of plugins** for endless functionalities; just try searching.

Through this section, you can **search and install new plugins**.

Plugins, after being installed, **must be activated** to function.

I hope this **general overview** has been helpful in understanding, in broad terms, **how WordPress works!**

I recommend trying to **spend some time** creating articles and pages, installing themes and plugins, and see what happens!

**Practice is the best way to learn!**
