There are numerous note-taking apps available online. I've tried almost all of them, but none have fully satisfied my needs.

When searching for a note-taking app, I require some fundamental features:

- Pleasant and minimalistic design (I dislike excess)
- Night mode
- Easy formatting (not too complicated, but at least the ability to bold text quickly)
- Availability on all devices (I dislike being restricted to either a PC or smartphone without the option to share)

Once I figured out how I wanted my note-taking app, all that was left was to start creating it!

And so, <a href="https://www.albynotes.albydev.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albertonotes</a> was born!

I drew inspiration primarily from Apple's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/note/id1110145109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Note</a> app and <a href="https://simplenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simplenote</a>, two fantastic apps. However, the former is only available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, while the latter allows formatting only in markdown, requiring constant switching between edited and rendered textâ€”not ideal.

So, I decided to take the best from both and combine it into something of my own.

## Technologies Used:

### PHP and MySQL

I considered doing everything in JavaScript, maybe with Node JS, but I'm very familiar with the [**PHP and MySQL stack**][1], and since it's a side project, I chose the simplest route for me.

### Ajax

To avoid reloading the page with every save or note change, I used Ajax calls. This way, the page remains fixed, with only the content of certain sessions changing. If I manage to create various desktop and mobile apps, this feature will be very useful and provide a pleasant user experience.

### Quill JS

For note formatting, I used **<a href="https://quilljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quill JS</a>**, a fantastic JavaScript editor that is straightforward to implement and manage.

I was undecided for a long time. In the past, I often used <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/demo/#inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CkEditor</a>, but it's a bit hefty. I was also interested in <a href="https://editorjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Editor Js</a>, which is visually appealing but seemed a bit early in development.

Quill JS is the best choice for me, at least for now.

### Orange Framework

I haven't talked much about it yet, but I built my framework in PHP to create my web apps.

I've worked with **Laravel** and **CodeIgniter**, but I find it more comfortable to do everything myself. I want to clarify that it's not about reinventing the wheel, as many say, but about developing things properly the first time and reusing them later.

I started by creating the login module, then studying a decent software architecture, and now I have a structure ready for use and, most importantly, portable. I can copy individual modules I'm interested in from one project to another, modify the configuration file, and be confident that they work.

You can try the app here: [https://www.albynotes.albydev.net][2]

It's still in **beta**, so any advice or bug reports are welcome!

Let me know in the comments what you think or if you want to know more.

I hope this article was interesting.
