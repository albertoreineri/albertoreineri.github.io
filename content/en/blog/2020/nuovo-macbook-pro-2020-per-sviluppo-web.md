Yes, I switched to **Apple**! I purchased the new MacBook Pro 2020.

It was a decision that I **[considered for a long time][1]**, evaluating every detail, and in the end, I decided to make the purchase. Was it worth it?

I'll tell you in this article. Being a **developer**, I will focus mainly on software, but I'll also touch on hardware a bit.

## Which MacBook?

Firstly, I must specify the model I bought. Apple's lineup, although always limited, includes machines with varying performance and power.

I brought home the **<a href="https://www.apple.com/it/macbook-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacBook Pro 2020 Base Model</a>** (8th-gen Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 250GB SSD).

In my opinion, it's currently the best compromise between price and performance. It's certainly much more expensive than its Windows equivalent, but upon closer inspection, it's not quite the same.

Sure, you can buy a Windows laptop with the same internal components for half the price, but that product will likely have a poor display, very noisy fans, a small and less usable touchpad, a plastic feel, a low-quality keyboard, etc.

Looking only at the main components might seem expensive, but if you compare it to a Windows competitor with the same build quality, like the Dell XPS 13, the price difference isn't that significant. If I have to spend 1500 euros on a 13-inch laptop, I'll go for an Apple.

Not because I hate Windows, quite the opposite, but macOS is much more pleasant and organized.

## Why Did I Switch to Apple?

**Unix** is the basic answer. Working more and more with the terminal, I felt the lack of this tool on Windows. I managed for a long time with WSL, but it's not the same.

I'm a bit **meticulous**, and having a PC with two terminals (cmd and PowerShell) plus other subsystems (I had Ubuntu and Kali Linux) creates a lot of disorder overall. Some things work only on Linux and require WSL, while others must run with PowerShell. All this disorder is disorienting and takes a lot of time in configurations.

On MacOS, the terminal works great and has a beautiful and elegant environment, which unfortunately I never found in Linux. Sure, Ubuntu looks cool in terms of design, but I never really felt comfortable with it, especially when using design tools.

## Did I Do the Right Thing?

Yes, I haven't regretted the choice yet. I already knew MacOS very well as I used it for almost ten years in the past. I switched to Windows because I never liked the butterfly keyboard or the exorbitant prices in recent years.

When I saw the new keyboard, the doubled SSD, and the lowered price (even if only by 20â‚¬), I decided it was time to return to MacOS.

As a developer, I am much more at ease. Everything I need works perfectly. Node.js, Git, LAMP stack, React, everything I installed runs very well.

Additionally, I can use a large number of gestures and shortcuts that are really useful and save me a lot of time.

There are thousands of articles on the web talking about the advantages of the trackpad, gestures, and such, but I discovered something that I haven't found written anywhere. Maybe it's just me in my pickiness who noticed it, but I found it fantastic. Here's what it is:

### Thumb vs. Pinky

Yes, let's talk about fingers. But let me explain. On Windows, the strong key on the keyboard is Ctrl; on Mac, it's Cmd. On Windows, the pinky is used a lot (Ctrl+C); on Mac, it's the thumb (Cmd+C).

Well, I really appreciated this on Mac. The thumb is very close to the trackpad and the space bar, and it's much easier to move the thumb than the pinky, anatomically.

This has sped up a lot of operations. Copy/paste, refreshing web pages, switching between software, everything is smoother.

## What I Love About MacOS

  * Fantastic trackpad
  * Thumb is better than pinky
  * Terminal
  * General quality
  * Battery
  * Software

## What I Miss

  * Games

## Conclusion

In the end, I don't think the price is so exaggerated. For someone like me who uses the computer for work, it's essential to have a reliable machine that I can count on, and it's helpful for it to be beautiful and enjoyable to look at and use.

Ultimately, the only thing I miss a little is games. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I like to spend half an hour playing in the evening, and for this, I still have to use my old PC. But that's okay; at least the Mac stays clean even in terms of software.

This is my experience with the new MacBook Pro so far; I hope it continues to go well.

_Happy coding!_
