Our website is starting to take shape, but some fundamental features are still missing!

Today, we will see how to add these functionalities to our WordPress site using plugins!

## WHAT ARE WORDPRESS PLUGINS?

WordPress plugins are pieces of code that create a specific functionality!

These pieces of code within the plugins allow the WordPress core to add or enhance its features!

For example, WordPress does not include the ability to create a contact form. To do this, you can simply download and install a plugin, and in this way, you can have your ready-to-use form!

Over the years, WordPress has become more and more famous, and the number of plugins has grown considerably! This is one of the reasons why WordPress is the most widely used CMS in the world.

Many plugins are free, but there are also some paid plugins that allow you to expand your site with powerful features at reasonable prices.

## ESSENTIAL PLUGINS

### WP FORMS

This plugin allows us to create a contact form quickly and easily!

First, access the backend of our WordPress site (if you don't know how, read the [previous guides](/categories/inizia-qui/)) and click on "Plugin – Add New."

You will see a screen like this:

Here, go to the top right, in the box "Search plugins..." and type WP Forms.

The search will start automatically, and after a few moments, you should see this plugin in the list:

After the plugin is installed, you can activate it by clicking "Activate."

This plugin makes creating forms a truly simple action! You can follow the guide provided by the plugin itself, and in less than five minutes, you will have your beautiful and functional form!

Next, click on the orange button "Create your first form."

Now you can click on "Simple Contact Form." The plugin will proceed to create a basic form. When it's done, you should see a screen like the following:

![](/images/image-5-1024x495-1.png)

On the right is the preview of the form, while on the left, you can add and modify the fields that make up the form.

There is also a paid version of this plugin, but for basic forms, the free version is sufficient.

Now click on "Save" at the top right and then on "Embed."

After clicking "Embed," a window like this will open:

What's written in the dark gray box is a shortcode: a code that allows something to appear within an article or page.

Now, all you have to do is copy this shortcode and paste it into the page where you want your contact form to appear.

After copying the shortcode, close WP Forms (with the X in the top right) and click on "Pages" in the sidebar.

Here, click on "Contact" to edit the page we [created earlier](/en/blog/lets-create-the-pages-of-our-first-website/).

Now all you have to do is paste the shortcode into the content of the page and click "Update" at the top right.

If we go to view our contact page now, we will see that the form created with WP Forms has appeared inside it!
