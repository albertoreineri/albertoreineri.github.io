I have published a small open-source project on <a href='https://github.com/albertoreineri/Simple-login-and-registration-in-php' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GitHub</a>, which I will probably expand in the future.

I wanted to release the entire **<a href='/orange' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Orange CMS</a>**, but since creating it was a significant effort, and I would need to work on making it downloadable, installable, and understandable for everyone to upload it to GitHub, for now, **I have started by publishing only a small foundation** to create a personal area in PHP.

It's a **very simple** login module, designed to be an idea to start developing a backend, a starting point.

## How to use?

It's very **simple**! Just follow these steps:

  * Clone the repository into your website folder
  * Create a database in phpMyAdmin
  * Import "user.sql" from the "database" folder
  * Enter the correct parameters in the "login/config.php" file
  * Go to "your-site/login"
  * Log in or create a new user

_Default user:_

_– Username: user_

_– Email: user@user.com_

_– Password: Username1!_

If you are looking for resources to create an administration area, a backend, or a web app, then this module might be suitable for you.

## Framework

It's true that there are many frameworks today that offer this functionality already integrated, but they are not always the best choice.

It depends on the type of project. If it is a large scalable project, then it is certainly better to go for a solid and extensively tested framework (always open source).

If it is a small web portal, a simple web app, or a project developed by a single developer without particular demanding features, then I think building everything from scratch can be a good option.

I hope it can be helpful!

_Happy coding!!!_
