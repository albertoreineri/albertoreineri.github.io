If you're delving into the WordPress world, you've likely come across the term "plugin" quite often. But what are they, and how do you use them? Let's explore together!

## WHAT ARE WORDPRESS PLUGINS?

WordPress plugins are **pieces of code that add functionality**! These code snippets, housed within plugins, enable the WordPress core to **extend or enhance its features**.

For instance, if WordPress lacks the ability to create a **contact form**, you can simply download and install a plugin to have your ready-to-use form.

Over the years, WordPress has gained immense popularity, and the **number** of plugins has grown **significantly**. This is one of the reasons why **WordPress is the most widely used CMS (Content Management System) globally**.

Many plugins are **free**, but there are also some premium ones that allow you to enhance your site with powerful features for a reasonable price.

## HOW TO INSTALL A PLUGIN

Now, let's see **how to install a plugin**. We'll install a fundamental feature that every website should have: a **contact form**.

For this purpose, we'll use the **[WPForms](http://en.wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)** plugin.

This plugin enables us to create a **contact form** quickly and easily!

First, **access the backend** of your WordPress site (if you're unsure how to do this, refer to the [previous guides](http://specialistawp.local/inizia-qui/inizia-qui-principiante/)) and click on "Plugin - Add New."

You'll be presented with a screen like this:

![Add New Plugin](/images/image.png)

Here, go to the top right corner, in the box labeled "**Search for pluginsâ€¦**," and type **WPForms**. The search will start automatically, and after a few moments, you should see this plugin in the list:

![WPForms Plugin](/images/image-1-1-1.png)

Now, all you need to do is click on "**Install Now**."

After the plugin is installed, you can activate it by clicking "**Activate**."

You'll then find yourself at this point:

![WPForms Welcome](/images/image-3-2.png)

This plugin makes form creation a truly **simple** task! So, you can now **follow the guide** provided by the plugin itself, and in less than five minutes, you'll have your beautiful and functional form!

Next, click on the orange button "**Create Your First Form**."

Now, you can click on "**Simple Contact Form**." The plugin will proceed to create a basic form. When it's done, you should see a screen like this:

![Form Preview](/images/image-5-1.png)

On the right is the form preview, and on the left, you can add and modify the fields that make up the form.

There is also a premium version of this plugin, but the free version is sufficient for basic forms.

Now, click on "**Save**" in the upper right corner and then on "Embed."

After clicking "**Embed**," a window like this will appear:

![Embed Form](/images/image-6-2.png)

What's written in the dark gray box is a **shortcode**: a code that allows something to appear within an article or page.

Now, all you need to do is **copy this shortcode** and paste it on the page where you want your contact form to appear.

After copying the shortcode, close WPForms (with the X in the upper right) and click on "**Pages**" in the side menu.

![Pages](/images/Annotazione-2020-03-31-170213-.png)

Here, click on "**Contact**" to edit the page we [created earlier](http://specialistawp.local/creiamo-le-pagine-del-nostro-primo-sito-web/).

Now, all that's left is to **paste the shortcode** into the content of the page and click on "**Update**" in the upper right.

If you **preview** your contact page now, you'll see that the form created with WPForms is now embedded!

**Exciting, isn't it? You've just installed and used your first plugin!**
