Many guides or tutorials demonstrate how to **install WordPress directly online**, often using the services provided by hosting companies to automatically install the CMS.

Although this practice is very simple and quick, **it is not the most recommended**, especially if you are or want to become a **developer** and, therefore, customize your site's code.

When approaching a new project, **the first step is to set up a local server** on your computer so that you can start writing the code for the site calmly, **without fear of potential bugs or crashes** (which will undoubtedly occur).

Therefore, every well-designed site will be developed **locally first**, and once finished and thoroughly debugged, it can be taken online and made available to the whole world!

This is crucial not only in the beginning during site creation but also later when **integrating features or making corrections**. Making changes directly **online** is very risky and highly unrecommended!
