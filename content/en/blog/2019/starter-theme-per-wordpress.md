After using WordPress for various projects, I decided to create and share my starter theme.

With this project, you can start from a pre-made base and speed up the development time for a new theme from scratch.

The theme already includes:
- bootstrap
- font awesome
- back on top

Developing themes from scratch allows for highly customized results, providing almost total customization, optimization of loading times, and increased site security, provided you know what you're doing.

## No pre-made themes

This is entirely my personal opinion, and it may be shared or not.

Personally, I have never felt comfortable with pre-made themes available on platforms like Themeforest or similar. There's always something I want to do but can't...

I prefer to start from scratch and have complete control over everything, be able to move as I want, take charge of problems, and solve them in what I think is the best way.

After all, I'm a developer, and I don't like drag and drop much... I prefer code!

But starting from scratch every time can be heavy, boring, and a waste of time. So I created a starter theme, a basic WordPress theme that already includes all the necessary layouts, some libraries, the search form, and other small things that allow me to start working on the fun part of the site immediately.

This way, I don't have to start from scratch every time; I already have a working skeleton ready to be used.

## Open Source Starter Theme for WordPress

After creating the Orange Starter Theme for WordPress and successfully using it on many websites, I decided to make it [open source](https://github.com/albertoreineri/orange-starter-theme), so it can be used and expanded by anyone.

Any possible bugs can be reported to me via [GitHub](https://github.com/albertoreineri/orange-starter-theme) or directly through the contact form on this site; I will take care of the problem and solve it as quickly as possible.
