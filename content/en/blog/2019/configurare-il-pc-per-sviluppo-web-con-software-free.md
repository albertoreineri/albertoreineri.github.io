Let's see which free software we can use for web development.

Are you getting into the programming world and want to start developing some websites or a small web app? Congratulations! Welcome to the fantastic world of Web Development!

To start, you'll need to install the necessary programs to write your first code and make what you've written "run." In this article, we'll quickly go over the software you'll need.

Let's set aside the eternal debate about which operating system is better for a particular thing, the trends that lead to choosing one PC over another, and things like that. All the software mentioned in this article is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

So, let's see what we need to develop websites and web apps.

## 1. BROWSER

If we intend to do some web development, the fundamental software we need is a browser. All operating systems come with a pre-installed browser, but my recommendation is to use [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/). This browser is very fast and offers a set of very useful **developer tools**.

I won't dwell on this point because you're probably already using Chrome or know perfectly well what it is. Let's move on and see other free software for web development.

## 2. TEXT EDITOR

To do web development, you need to write code, and to write code, you need a text editor. It's possible to write code even with Notepad, but it's certainly not an optimal solution.

My recommendation is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a fantastic free software from Microsoft!

Rich in features and extensions, it allows you to manage projects very well, also thanks to the internal **terminal** in the interface.

This is definitely the essential program for any programmer.

## 3. LOCAL SERVER

To "make" our projects run on our computer, it's necessary to install a local server to make them work.

I've been using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for years, also free software that includes **MySQL**. Incredibly useful and easy to use, it allows you to configure a local server and start your project in **PHP** in just a few minutes.

Essential for creating sites in **WordPress**, for projects in PHP frameworks like **Laravel** or **CodeIgniter**, or even for work in **Core PHP**.

## 4. FTP CLIENT

Once we've finished our site, we need to **upload it online**!

To do this, you can use an **FTP Client** that allows you to **connect to the hosting** and upload the site's files.

The most commonly used software for this task is definitely [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). Free, simple, and intuitive, it's the right choice for setting up your site easily, quickly, and efficiently.

## 5. GRAPHICS

Finally, let's not forget that every project also has a graphic part!

To **develop the layouts** of your projects, I recommend using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I've been using this software for a while, and I'm really satisfied, plus it's **completely free**! Just sign up with your Google account, and voil√†! You can start creating fantastic web layouts and more!

All these software are **free** and **cross-platform**, except for the next one, unfortunately.

I'm talking about [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), a fabulous Adobe software that allows you to do everything you want with photos and images. Although many of these things can also be done with Figma, **I still can't completely detach myself from this software**, which remains the only paid one in my setup...

If you want to try a valid alternative, there's [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), which they say should be very powerful. Unfortunately, having started with Photoshop and knowing it quite well by now, I don't feel like starting from scratch to learn a new program... I'll leave it up to you to judge!

That's **all you need**! Now you can start getting creative with [code and design](https://open.spotify.com/show/546eUw3PsRI1HUGbBUeghC) and create your first projects!

Thanks for reading this article.

_Happy coding!_
