Choosing the right technology for your website is a crucial step.

**Being online is essential today**!

A **website** allows you to be **easily found** by everyone worldwide, creates a **corporate image**, enables **fast communication** with your customers, and much more... In short, it undoubtedly brings **benefits** to businesses **of all types**, whether large or small.

**_But not all websites are the same!_**

There are various **types of websites** (showcase, blog, e-commerce, etc.), but, above all, there are **many technologies with which to build them.**

For the **non-professionals**, knowing how their website was created might not matter; what's important is that it works! **But knowing a bit more can make a big difference.**

_When building a house, we always ensure that the best materials are used!_

This should also be the case for websites. It's good to rely on experts in the field, web developers, or web agencies, but **it's better not to blindly trust** and insist on understanding how the project will be executed.

For example, much is said about **WordPress**, a fantastic platform (this site is built on WordPress) when used correctly, but it's not the only or always the best option.

## WordPress, yes, but how is it used?

WordPress is the **most widely used platform worldwide** for website development. It allows for very good results with a low time investment, thus **lower costs** compared to other solutions.

**_But there's a right and wrong way to use it._**

WordPress is so widespread that there are **thousands of free and paid themes** to create a website, and developers often take advantage of it.

Selling a WordPress site for €2,000 "developed" by purchasing a €50 theme and slightly configuring it is borderline fraud... Yet it happens, and quite often.

For this reason, it's **better to investigate a bit** about what you're having built, ask questions, and be persistent in knowing how the final product will be realized.

Personally, when I choose to use WordPress, I **develop the theme and plugins dedicated to the project entirely from scratch**. This allows for having a **unique, performant, and secure** site without significantly impacting the final cost. An experienced developer, with the right skills, can create a complete WordPress theme from scratch in a few weeks, not more.

In addition to this site you are reading, I can give you the example of **[Bikeitalia.it](http://bikeitalia.it/)**, a truly enormous site, with peaks of **users exceeding 4,000 at the same time.** Well, that site is based on **WordPress**, but the theme was **built from scratch.**

**So, WordPress is not bad at all, provided it's used correctly.** This will prevent unpleasant surprises like performance drops or, worse, security vulnerabilities.

## Javascript

Today there are also many **Javascript frameworks** that allow for creating modern, **lightweight, and very fast websites!**

You can use React, Angular, or Vue, or even **Gatsby**, a framework based on React that allows for creating beautiful websites in a short time. In this case, however, the **content management will be completely different, often more complicated.**

But if you want to **focus on performance**, this is undoubtedly the best choice.

## Proprietary CMS

A third option is proprietary CMS. Many web agencies and developers **have their own website creation systems.**

These can be **good** or **bad** solutions, depending on the developers. In any case, **since they are developed from scratch, they usually allow for maximum configuration.**

You can do whatever you want without having to adhere to the laws of CMS and frameworks.

However, it's necessary to **ensure that these frameworks are up-to-date**, not stuck in the past.

Here are some **tips** to understand if they are up to today's standards:

### SEO-Friendly URLs

If the **page URL ends with ".php", ".asp", ".html"**, or something similar, it means that there is no real routing system on the site, and this does not allow for good URLs, which are more appreciated by Google.

**Good URL example**: "http://www.yoursite.com/contact/"

**Not-so-good URL example**: "http://www.yoursite.com/contact.asp"

### Indices in URLs

If you see codes and mathematical symbols in the URL, **the security of the site may be at risk**. Many systems "pass" database indices in the URL, but this can be **used by hackers for a direct attack on the database.** So, if you see a URL like "http://www.yoursite.com/article.php?id=45", then the system is **not very secure.**

## 404 Errors

Another characteristic of systems developed from scratch is that they often don't have a **management for errors**, such as the classic 404 Page Not Found. To find out, simply go to a site and enter random text after the domain, for example, "http://yoursite.com/goodbye". If there is a 404 page in the site, great, if you see the server error on a blank and ugly page, then it's not ideal.

All these little things can **make your efforts to create a functional website fail**, affecting **Google indexing**, **performance**, and **security**.

## Orange CMS

An example of a proprietary CMS is **[Orange CMS](/orange)**, my solution developed entirely from scratch.

If you want, **[you can take a look](/orange)**, enter the backend, and **create and view articles and pages.** I have already used it for many sites, and the results have always been very good, superior to WordPress in terms of **performance**, but it all depends on the features you

 want.

I hope this article has helped you **understand how to approach the creation of your new website.** Remember that the choice of technology is crucial, and **you will carry it with you for a long time**, so it must be done with method and professionalism.
