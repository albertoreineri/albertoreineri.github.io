"Do you have a slow WordPress site? Does it frequently freeze, leaving you frustrated just by looking at it? Let's see how to improve it!

WordPress is **the world's most widely used platform** for creating websites, but it often happens that it is used in a non-optimal way.

This can cause **serious slowdowns** on the site.

WordPress, while fantastic, comes with a somewhat **heavy core** of its own, and if you install themes and plugins **left and right**, it will soon become **extremely slow**, not only damaging the user experience but also affecting SEO indexing.

## What Slows Down Your WordPress Site?

The reasons your WordPress site is slow can be **varied**. Here are the main causes listed:

- **Web Hosting**: If the web hosting server is not configured correctly or is of poor quality, the site will undoubtedly be affected. You can have a perfectly developed site, but if the server it runs on is not optimized, the results will be poor.
- **WordPress Configuration**: If your site does not offer cache storage, it can overload the server, causing slowdowns or site crashes.
- **Image Size**: One of the major causes of slowdowns is huge images. Many large images on the same page will significantly slow down loading times.
- **Low-Quality Plugins**: Using plugins with errors, incorrect code, or unnecessary features will undoubtedly result in slowdowns, if not security issues.
- **External Scripts**: All various scripts external to the site, such as ads, fonts, tracking systems, etc., will slow down the site.

But let's go into more detail.

## Having Good Hosting Makes a Difference

Hosting is **the foundation on which your site is built**. If the foundations are not of quality, no matter how perfect what is built on them is, it will undoubtedly be destined to **collapse**.

Having good hosting service, with **state-of-the-art features** and 24/7 support, allows you to sleep soundly, have everything under control, and be **sure** that the site will run correctly at all times.

As mentioned earlier, you can have a perfectly developed site, fully optimized, with images of the right size, scripts loaded correctly, everything perfect. **But if the hosting is not good, this site will still perform poorly.**

I have already created a custom theme from scratch, spending many hours optimizing each server request so as not to overload it as much as possible, and then get poor results in performance tests. This is very frustrating and **harmful** to the website.

You need to rely on true professionals who can **choose the best service based on your needs**.

There is no perfect hosting always; you need to **evaluate the needs** and choose accordingly.

## WordPress Configuration

### Cache

It is possible to speed up a slow WordPress site quickly and easily by installing a plugin for **cache management**.

There are many, even free ones, but it is necessary to know how to **configure them correctly**.

You can get good results by using the default configurations of the plugin, but by setting **each parameter individually** based on the site, **performance will increase significantly**.

### Updates

Another best practice is always to keep the site updated. Not updating is also risky from a security standpoint, so **always ensure that your site is up to date, as well as various plugins.**

## Optimize Images

Having many images is one of the first causes of a slow WordPress site.

However, the solution is not to remove them all and have pages with only text. Fortunately, there are many tools that can **optimize images** for the web.

The best software to optimize an image for the web is **[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/it/products/photoshop.html)**, but you can also do it for free with online tools like **[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/e/)**.

Images must be saved in the **correct dimensions**; it is useless to have a 5000x5000 image. Exceeding 1920 px in width is almost always unnecessary, so make sure to load images in the correct and **lightest possible format**.

### Formats

Use only two types of formats: **JPG and PNG**.

**PNG** should only be used when the image has **transparencies**, for example, a logo.

For all **photos**, I recommend using **JPG** because it is lighter.

## Be Careful with Plugins

Plugins are very useful for a WordPress site, but you should **never install them too lightly**.

Before installing a new plugin, always check the **update log**, see if it is still **maintained** by the developers, and take a look at the **reviews**.

Also, it is important to **always update them** to the latest version.

Having too many poorly developed plugins causes **huge problems** for WordPress sites, both for **performance** and **security**.

## External Scripts

Many times it is essential to include external scripts, such as Google Ads. However, these have a **negative impact on performance**. It is necessary to take this into account and **optimize elsewhere if absolutely necessary**.

## Conclusion

**Having a fast and efficient WordPress site is possible; you just need to develop it properly.**

The best solution is always to **use a professionally developed theme from scratch**, built based on the site's needs.

**Generic themes**, free or paid, are created to be used for various types of websites and therefore have many **features that often prove useless** and slow down the site.

The same goes for **plugins**. Where possible, it is always better to use a **plugin developed from scratch** specifically for the functionality it needs to perform.

The best solution for having a high-performance WordPress site is, therefore, to **rely on a WordPress expert** who can understand the site's needs and **create the best solution**. This ensures **high performance** and also a higher level of **security**."
