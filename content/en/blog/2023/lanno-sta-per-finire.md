Also, this 2023 has now come to an end, finally! It has been a particularly challenging year for me, and I am glad to be able to turn the page and face something new. From a professional standpoint, it has been a positive year. I completed a series of significant projects, such as the restyling of the bikeitalia.it website, with which I have been collaborating for years. I had the opportunity to engage with highly skilled developers, contributing to my professional growth.

However, on a personal level, this 2023 has been a nightmare for my health. I was well until the summer, after which my stomach and intestinal issues made life difficult for me. I am currently better, but unfortunately, I cannot say I am well yet. It's a situation I have been dealing with for years, and I have almost learned to live with it, although I will never fully get used to it.

But this won't stop me from realizing what I have in mind! It is precisely from here that the idea of ​​changing my website and bringing it to the current version arises! I do many things, things that often remain locked in my drawer. Well, this site will be my new drawer! Here, I will publish all my creations, whether they are software, sculptures, or music! This way, I can unleash my creativity and have a repository to organize and browse through everything I do!

I have many musical pieces sitting on my computer, stories never read by anyone, sculptures locked in my display case, and software never made public! Soon, everything will be online, ready to get some air!

I have no expectations for this site; it will be more of a catalog for myself, to review my activities and organize my thoughts. However, it will be public for all of you too!

Well, today is the second-to-last day of the year, and I no longer feel like writing. See you in the new year!!!!

Many warm regards!
