Would you like to execute PHP code without refreshing the page? With AJAX, you can do it!

An AJAX call is an asynchronous request sent from a web browser to a web server, using the JavaScript language. The web server can respond to the AJAX call with data in JSON, XML, or HTML format, which can then be processed by the web browser to dynamically update a part of the web page without having to reload the entire page.
