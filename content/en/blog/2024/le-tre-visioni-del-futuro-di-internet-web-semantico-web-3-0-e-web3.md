Internet, one of the greatest creations of modern technology, is in constant evolution. At the heart of this ongoing development are three distinct visions of what the Internet might become: Web 3.0, Web3, and the Semantic Web. In this article, we'll explore how these three ideas guide the technological and architectural future of the Internet, united by technologies like blockchain, generative AI, and HTMX.

## Web 3.0: The Future of the Internet
Web 3.0 represents the broadest vision among the three shaping the future of the Internet. It embraces and cross-pollinates the ideas of the other two, essentially taking the concepts of Web 2.0 and asking, "What's next?"

Web 2.0 generally refers to the web developed in the early 21st century, introducing user-modifiable applications like social media and technological innovations like Ajax. This iteration differs radically from the simple HTML and cumbersome JavaScript snippets of Web 1.0.

We are currently in the process of developing Web 3.0, anticipating applications that will render the current web obsolete. Although the term Web 3.0 is sometimes associated with specific ideas or technologies, it fundamentally represents the next generation of Internet software and interfaces.

The evolution from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is evident in the progress of modern applications. While technologies like cloud computing, reactive frameworks (e.g., React), and NoSQL databases characterize Web 2.5, the true essence of Web 3.0 is challenging to define. However, blockchain emerges as the forefront technology underpinning this new phase, fundamentally changing how the Internet operates. Although not technically synonymous with Web 3.0, blockchain advocates have adopted the term Web3 to represent the evolution they envision.

## Web3 is not Web 3.0
In the time-honored tradition of overloading terms for maximum confusion, Web 3.0 and Web3 mean similar but different and vaguely defined things. The two terms are frequently used synonymously, representing two different ways of referring to the same overarching idea.

The distinctions, however, are crucial to maintain because Web 3.0 primarily refers to the overall character of the next web, while Web3 focuses on the parallel realm of blockchain innovations.

Web3 will have a significant impact on the final meaning of Web 3.0. In practice, Web 3.0 will incorporate Web3. If blockchain ends up having a big enough role in the future of the Internet (which is expected), Web 3.0 could end up being Web3.

We'll discuss blockchain's influence more, but first, let's consider the third player in the current evolution of the Internet.

## The Semantic Web
The idea of the Semantic Web comes from the creator of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, and others. Essentially, the Semantic Web incorporates metadata into the information issued by applications. This metadata describes the meaning, intent, and relationships of the data (semantics), transforming the Internet into a machine-navigable web of interconnected resources.

In essence, the Semantic Web seeks to transform the Internet from a database into a knowledge base. It is a natural extension or elaboration of the existing web and probably has the most official claim to Web 3.0 given its pedigree. Moving the implementation forward in practice is tricky, however, because it increases effort without benefiting the application or its developers. In part, it also requires abandoning familiar technologies like RESTful APIs that are not really RESTful. In the long term, technologies like JSON-LD and HTMX will mediate the adoption of Semantic Web ideas, leading to a more meaningful and navigable web.

## Generative AI and the Semantic Web
When we consider the Semantic Web and Web3 together, we have two potent trends charting the future course of Web 3.0: decentralization (Web3) and data linking (Semantic Web). The first is an upstart, the other the standing heir.

In Berners-Lee’s introduction to the idea of the Semantic Web, he introduces the browser of the future, which will hold the contextual information to empower the user’s interactions.

Funny enough, we've just passed a sort of tipping point with generative AI, and while it's no C-3PO, genAI's impact on the future development of the web will be significant. The drive to make data more semantic, contextual, and relatable took a huge step forward with the advent of modern AI, especially large language models. And it turns out we didn't need to add semantic data, after all. Instead, we just created giant probability machines to simulate it after the fact.

Where the idea of semantic metadata has only come together in a slow and piecemeal fashion, generative AI has taken the world by storm. Suddenly, the big pile of inert information encapsulated in URLs has come to life.

Without question, generative AI will influence Web 3.0. Whether it represents a total upheaval remains to be seen. We may in fact already be over the big hump (or hype cycle) for this generation of AI, and into the next phase of extrapolating its finer details (

similar to blockchain being in a similar life cycle, what Gartner calls the plateau of productivity).

## Blockchain, AI, and the Future Web
It remains to be seen exactly where the boundary will be drawn between traditional applications and blockchain applications (also known as dApps—distributed apps), but we'll eventually see elements of the blockchain touching virtually every aspect of the web. Currently, blockchain is heavily impacting the financial industry, where decentralized finance (DeFi) is upsetting the apple cart with near-instantaneous, low-fee transactions that don’t require a broker, bank, or clearinghouse.

Identity and authorization are probably next on the list to be fundamentally changed by blockchain. See things like Sign in with Ethereum (SiWE) for a taste of what's to come.

Next up is AI, used as both a tool for building software and a tool used in software. In the first use, developers have already become accustomed to employing AI as a coding assistant (including its sometimes confounding mistakes). In the near future, we'll probably see more sophisticated applications for design and architecture, data manipulation, and more. We can also expect AI-augmented applications to make the interface between people and data less awkward.

All of this brings us to an interesting question: which technology will exert more influence over the future of the Internet? I believe blockchain will ultimately play a more differentiating role. The reason is that generative AI takes existing procedures and makes them (sometimes radically) more effective. But blockchain does something fundamentally different: trustless, public, secure computing.

## Conclusion
Web 3.0 implies the full use of Web 2.0 techniques (including user interactivity, cloud platforms, reactivity, and NoSQL) with the increasing incorporation of elements from blockchain, semantics, and generative AI. Generative AI will have a significant impact, but blockchain might exert a more differentiating role, offering an approach of public and secure computing beyond optimizing existing procedures. The future of the Internet seems to be a harmonious combination of these visions, guided by technologies and teams that make a gradual melding and refinement of this concoction manageable.
