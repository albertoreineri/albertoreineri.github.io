If you've been following me for a while, you probably know how much I love the [Linux][1] world! It's an environment that sometimes gives me a headache, makes me angry, forces me to dig into things to understand how they work, but it also has the beauty of making us feel more in control of our PCs, understand how they work under the hood, and manage them better to our liking!

Oh, before someone starts insulting me, in this article, I'm talking about Linux Desktop! I've been using Linux exclusively on my servers for years, and everything runs smoothly there! (Even on the server, though, it's not all that automatic; you need to study to understand the basics, but once everything is set up, it works great!)

Well, with the necessary explanations made, let's get to the point!

## I'm still on Mac OS&#8230;

If you've watched my recent videos, you've surely noticed that I've filmed everything on [Mac OS][2]. Well, yes, after repeatedly stating my love for Linux, here I am still using my MacBook Pro&#8230; What kind of inconsistent person am I&#8230;..

I'm not afraid to admit it; I often tell myself, I'm inconsistent, and I don't like it at all&#8230; But unfortunately, it's not that simple.

I've tried several times to switch permanently to Linux, but I've always had to backtrack, and now I think I've found the definitive reason, but as a good storyteller, I'll only reveal it at the end of this article. (Of course, if you're really impatient, you can quickly scroll to the conclusion&#8230;)

## Why I love Linux

There are many reasons why I love the Linux world, but the thing I prefer is that it disconnects from every marketing mechanism that constantly afflicts us today. We don't have time to buy something before it's already replaced by a more performant model. And finally, products have a predetermined lifespan; planned obsolescence is now a given!

I don't like this at all&#8230;. I don't want to waste time watching fantastic product presentations that make me want to waste my money on often unnecessary equipment&#8230;

Moreover, Linux is meritocratic! The more you know, the less you struggle, that's it. If you're a beginner, you hate it with all your heart, then when you start tinkering with it properly, you can't do without it! You're the master of your machine, and you can use it exactly as you want!

Finally, in a world where our privacy no longer has much value, our metadata are in plain sight, and cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important, open source can guarantee a good level of protection! I'm not a privacy fanatic; I also have a Gmail account, but I believe you need to have the right awareness, try to strike a balance between accessing any content with our personal data and encrypting every single file on the PC&#8230; No paranoia, but not too much laxity either.

## Why I haven't fully switched to Linux yet

As I mentioned at the beginning, I'm still on Mac, even if I'm not fully satisfied&#8230; And all this is because of the hardware I have available, at least that's what I'm telling myself right now.

Some time ago, I saw a very interesting video from one of my favorite creators: Riccardo Palombo. In a YouTube video, he said, "We don't need new hardware, but new software," or something very similar. What a wonderful title! But unfortunately, it doesn't work for me&#8230;.

Hold on a moment, Riccardo is right, and I agree with him on the software issue, but I've noticed that, at least for me, hardware is also very, very important!

If I'm writing from my MacBook Pro, it's certainly not for Mac OS, nor for the software inside. I don't even care much about Photoshop lately, but it's for the hardware!

The keyboard, touchpad, screen, battery, microphone, fans, and charging times are good on my Mac, and I'm still talking about the Intel version. There's nothing exceptional, but everything works great; I've never had crashes, and it's a well-balanced computer and, all in all, quiet (except when I work with Docker&#8230;)

Besides the Mac, I have an ASUS notebook where I use Linux, and I've come to the conclusion that the weakest point of the PC is precisely the hardware&#8230; In particular, I have a dreadful screen, very noisy fans, and a ridiculous battery&#8230;

Certainly, it's not the right notebook to use with Linux, but when I bought it, I didn't think I would become penguin-dependent ? ?.

With the Mac, on the other hand, I can work peacefully without fear of running out of battery without realizing it, being able to record my podcast directly from the laptop's microphone without attaching anything external (also because it doesn't have many ports ?), and I can go through the day with my eyes still healthy and not tearing up like when I use the ASUS&#8230;.

The only way I work well with the ASUS is by using it as if it were a desktop PC. I attach an external keyboard, mouse, and screen, close it, and forget I have a notebook, then I have to say it works very well.

Unfortunately, though, for my lifestyle, it's essential to have a laptop I can trust. I often move for a few days to the mountains where I don't have much space, and for the moment, the Mac is really convenient!

Advantages: with a single charger, I can charge the Mac, Smartphone, and iPad (with a USB-C to Lightning connector), I can use the iPad as a second screen without connecting any cables, and I can do without the mouse because the touchpad is fantastic!

## Conclusion

And voil√†, that's it! So now I'm still trapped in the Apple world. For heaven's sake, if I put aside ideological concepts, I could stay like this for life, but the pumping marketing, overpricing, and the "fashion" factor don't make me feel entirely comfortable&#8230;

How can I solve it? I should try to get my hands on a nice ThinkPad or XPS and see how I feel, but at the moment, I don't have the budget available to do this test&#8230;

It should also be said that choosing a laptop for Linux is not that easy&#8230;. Companies specializing in Linux notebooks are emerging, such as the Spanish Slimbook, but I need to study their products better before making a purchase.

In the end, all I need is a notebook with 4 quality components: keyboard, touchpad, battery, and screen. Unfortunately, it often happens that Windows laptops focus a lot on the processor and RAM and less on the user experience, which, for us programmers, is very important, at least for me.

If I have to spend ten hours a day on the PC, it must at least be nice and pleasant to use!

That's all for now; as soon as I get my hands on a ThinkPad, I'll let you know more!
