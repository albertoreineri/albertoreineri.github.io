Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a Freelance Web Developer and Designer and in my free time I love to be in nature.

In these pages you will find a little bit of everything, from tips and guides for programmers to personal opinions on technology but not only.

This is a very simple site. Few images and no frills! For work I often find myself creating animated and engaging layouts, but personally I love simplicity. I therefore wanted to make my site in a different way, MINIMALIST: a simple black sheet with white words, nothing more, as if it were written on paper (but in night mode).

About me
----------

I was born in 1991 in a small town in the province of Cuneo in Italy, among cultivated fields and farms.

Since I was a child I have always loved nature and technology, two distant but equally fascinating worlds.

I studied Accounting, Programming major (I have no idea if it still exists nowadays) and I started working immediately, as soon as I finished my studies.

Since 2010 I have been working as a programmer, first in a Windows environment, developing management and billing software in .NET (I hated developing billing software, zero creativity ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢). Over time I moved to the web world, initially using ASP and then moving on to PHP, which has remained my main language to this day, along with Javascript. I also worked a little bit with Python, but not much ...

In the meantime, I studied Theology and for a few years I taught in the Italian school. I love philosophy, literature and I really enjoyed teaching. Unfortunately due to some health problems I was forced to abandon that path. I therefore resumed programming full time, this time as a freelancer.

Today I actively collaborate with several innovative companies in the Italian landscape and I create creative and effective websites and e-commerce for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Freelance Web Developer
----------

As a Developer I mainly work in PHP.

For complex projects I use Laravel or Symfony, depending on the result to be obtained.

For Showcase, Blog, Portfolio websites, I often use WordPress, creating custom themes and customizing the platform to suit the client's needs. I have created important journalistic websites with millions of monthly users with WordPress and I have had the opportunity to appreciate its flexibility and potential.

I have also created important e-commerce capable of supporting a large customer base while maintaining ease of management.

I am also in charge of a project to develop a framework suitable for medium-sized projects: [Orange](/orange). Lately, however, it has been stuck for a few years, I have no longer found the time to update it and follow it as it should, unfortunately ... I started rewriting it using Larvel to modernize it a bit!

Open Source
----------

I greatly appreciate the world of open source, both from a technological and philosophical point of view. When possible, I try to participate in interesting projects and I also release some small software: <https://github.com/albertoreineri>, such as Orange Starter Theme, a starter theme for WordPress developers, or my scripts for creating restricted areas, sending emails with Ajax, and more.

Where I live
----------

I decided to become a freelance developer with the goal of working from "*home*", wherever it may be.

Since 2019, I have tried to take this path and I have to say that after the first two years of hard work, sweat, worries, anger, and more, I am now starting to reap the fruits of my labor and I am starting to taste the freedom of independent work.

I have established important collaborations with companies that I admire and appreciate, and now I have the good fortune of being able to choose the companies with which to collaborate.

Now I live alternating between a small house in the mountains, at 1,200 meters above sea level, surrounded by nature, and a small apartment in the village, in the province of Cuneo.
