      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my New Website!&#xA;I know, it might seem unconventional. There&amp;rsquo;s no WOW effect as one would expect, at least not in the form of flashy or extravagant animations. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple website, primarily text-based. It might seem like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully comply with Google&amp;rsquo;s rules, but in reality, there&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye.&#xA;Why Such an SEO-Unfriendly Website I decided to make a radical change! Originally, this site was the showcase of my Freelance Web Developer business.</description>

      <description>Would you like to execute PHP code without refreshing the page? With AJAX, you can do it!&#xA;An AJAX call is an asynchronous request sent from a web browser to a web server, using the JavaScript language. The web server can respond to the AJAX call with data in JSON, XML, or HTML format, which can then be processed by the web browser to dynamically update a part of the web page without having to reload the entire page.</description>

      <description>Not long ago, I wrote an article praising Git, a version control software I can&amp;rsquo;t live without. So, I decided to create a guide to explain how to use GIT!&#xA;BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY USE GIT? IS IT HARD TO USE? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the fact that &amp;ldquo;Git&amp;rdquo; can be translated as &amp;ldquo;idiot,&amp;rdquo; almost suggesting that it&amp;rsquo;s foolproof&amp;hellip;&#xA;Jokes aside, it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to use, and it can also be a good starting point to learn the Command Line Interface (CLI)!</description>

      <description>Today, I want to share my experience using these two operating systems, the eternal battle between Windows and Mac. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss it from both a developer&amp;rsquo;s and an average user&amp;rsquo;s perspective since I use the computer for work and leisure, for programming, answering emails, writing documents, scheduling appointments, and more.&#xA;During my ten years of programming, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to use both Windows and Mac, each for several years. I&amp;rsquo;ve reached my conclusion, which is somewhat contrary to the usual discussions on various forums and social media in the industry.</description>

      <description>I began writing code almost ten years ago, using different languages, libraries, and frameworks, but the desire to always learn something new has not yet left me, fortunately.&#xA;For the past couple of years, a little word has been wandering in my mind that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to shake off: Python.&#xA;If you do a quick search online about programming languages, you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably come across a flood of articles related to this language.</description>

      <description>Development on Linux I have been developing software and websites for more than ten years now (with a break in between), and I have had the opportunity to use both Windows and Mac as well as Linux.&#xA;While I have primarily used Windows and Mac, during the last period where I worked closely with system administrators and did much more backend development than frontend, I felt the need to switch to something more performance-oriented for these activities.</description>

Frameworks are also thriving today, becoming more advanced and sophisticated.&#xA;And what about good old handwritten code? Does it still exist?</description>

      <description>Today, &amp;ldquo;from scratch&amp;rdquo; development is becoming less common. Lower budgets and tighter timelines have forced most developers to start from an existing foundation when creating their projects.&#xA;I still personally love developing &amp;ldquo;from scratch,&amp;rdquo; but living in today&amp;rsquo;s world and unable to spend nights writing code, I had to adapt to the current environment and start using some frameworks myself.&#xA;For some, these may be simple tips, but many times when faced with the choice between angular, vue, react, or laravel or codeigniter, the decision can be challenging.</description>

But how can they be removed?&#xA;WordPress allows anyone to set up a functioning website in very little time and with very low costs.&#xA;However, this also means having many websites created by non-professionals who install themes and plugins randomly without really knowing what they are doing.</description>

For the few who don&amp;rsquo;t know who this person is (I hope they are really very few&amp;hellip;), he is the creator of Linux. If we consider that more than half of the web and the majority of smartphones operate thanks to code written by him, we all owe him gratitude for his genius and generosity.</description>
