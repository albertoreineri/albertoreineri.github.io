			<description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my New Website!
I know, it might seem unconventional. There&amp;rsquo;s no WOW effect as one would expect, at least not in the form of flashy or extravagant animations. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple website, primarily text-based. It might seem like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully comply with Google&amp;rsquo;s rules, but in reality, there&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye.
Why Such an SEO-Unfriendly Website I decided to make a radical change! Originally, this site was the showcase of my Freelance Web Developer business.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s my New Website!</p>
<p>I know, it might seem unconventional. <strong>There&rsquo;s no WOW effect</strong> as one would expect, at least not in the form of flashy or extravagant animations. It&rsquo;s a simple website, primarily text-based. It might seem like <strong>it doesn&rsquo;t fully comply with Google&rsquo;s rules</strong>, but in reality, there&rsquo;s more than meets the eye.</p>
<h2 id="why-such-an-seo-unfriendly-website">Why Such an SEO-Unfriendly Website</h2>
<p>I decided to make a radical change! Originally, this site was the <strong>showcase of my Freelance Web Developer business</strong>. In the past, it had vibrant colors, animations, and effects to showcase my skills and attract new clients.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I no longer need to <em>show off</em> that much. This is for various reasons:</p>
<h3 id="no-economic-need-to-find-new-clients">No economic need to find new clients</h3>
<p>At the moment, I find myself in a rather stable situation (<em>as stable as a VAT business can be&hellip;</em>). I have satisfying long-term collaborations and fill my days with programming. I always welcome new clients and projects, even though I recently had to decline some and direct potential clients to other entities! Being a solo Freelancer, I don&rsquo;t have the structure to expand indefinitely, and honestly, I don&rsquo;t want to create it at the moment. For now, I&rsquo;m content with staying solo. However, this means I have to turn down some work. Days have a limited number of hours, and my mind has a limited number of projects it can handle, so for now, I can say I&rsquo;m saturated.</p>
<p>Perhaps in a few years, I&rsquo;ll open up to new possibilities, or I&rsquo;ll strengthen current collaborations even more and quit freelancing altogether&hellip; Who knows&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see how things evolve! There&rsquo;s no point in looking too far ahead; the world is constantly changing, and we must always be ready to adapt!</p>
<h3 id="i-want-a-website-that-represents-me">I want a website that represents me</h3>
<p>My site must be first and foremost <strong>mine</strong>! It may seem obvious, but today, to <em>attract</em> the audience, you have to appear cool, modern, lively, joyful, and then some! In the past, I did it because it was necessary, but in reality, I&rsquo;m not like that&hellip;
I&rsquo;m a rather serious, calm, and composed person. I love silence and tranquility; I don&rsquo;t like things that are too flashy&hellip;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself boxed in; I&rsquo;ve always had long hair, dressed casually, and I&rsquo;m quite liberal, but I tend to take things seriously, perhaps too much.</p>
<h3 id="showcase">Showcase</h3>
<p>This site is no longer my showcase, or better to say, its being a showcase is no longer a central factor.
For now, the promotional pages <a href="/services">Services</a> and <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a> are still active, but I don&rsquo;t exclude the possibility of removing them in the future and keeping only the blog. Also, I plan to create an Extra section to include what I do outside the web world.</p>
<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>
<p>However, SEO is indeed present on this site. The Lighthouse tests are very positive, and I expect the indexing to improve. It&rsquo;s true that there are no images, but the content is already widely read, and now the loading times have greatly improved. Only time will tell if all this can work.</p>
<h3 id="exiting-social-media">Exiting Social Media</h3>
<p>As a long-term goal, I would like to use this site as my only online presence.
I&rsquo;ve been fed up with social networks for a long time. They are becoming more and more invasive, and every time I think about what they bring to my life, there are more things they take away from me than what they give me. Therefore, I hope to get out of them soon. I&rsquo;m forced to keep them active because I sometimes use them for work, but I hope to close them shortly and be present online only through this site. If it happens, I&rsquo;ll also create an &ldquo;Extra&rdquo; section to gather some of my curiosities outside of programming.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-site-works">How This Site Works</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by saying that this site is developed with Hugo, an open-source framework for creating static sites. This allows me to manage it entirely through GitHub. So, I gave up my personal domain and am using <a href="https://albertoreineri.github.io/">albertoreineri.github.io</a>. The only thing I had to give up is the email associated with my personal domain, so I use Gmail. This has never been a problem for my clients over the years, and it saves me from managing domain, DNS, and server for this site. One less job for me!</p>
<p>But how does this particular site work? Well, it&rsquo;s not actually difficult&hellip;
The main thing is that the navbar is moved down, not at the top like on all other sites. This is to make the site more convenient to use, more app-style. If you open it from mobile, you can use the navbar simply with your thumb without stretching it to the top of the screen, but by clicking comfortably at the bottom.</p>
<p>This site is oriented towards a pleasant reading experience. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s only a dark mode. Reading white text on a dark background is more relaxing for the eyes and stresses the mind less.
Also, the structure presents only text without a sidebar or anything else. Sometimes the table of contents is on the right, always to improve content readability. Finally, on scroll, the navbar disappears completely, and the text becomes the only thing on the page to ensure the best possible reading experience.</p>
<p>Scrolling up or reaching the bottom of the page will make the navbar visible again, and you can change pages.</p>
<p>As additional features, there&rsquo;s the possibility to search the site&rsquo;s content and multilingual support, which is still in development but will be online soon.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is my new site. I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last! As a web developer, I&rsquo;m always looking for new challenges, and the best way to understand a technology is to try it directly. It could be completely different in two months, or I could remain faithful to this approach for years.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ll keep you informed on this blog!</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

			<title>I am officially a WordPress Developer.</title>

			<description>Today my plugin was approved, and it has been published in the official WordPress repository! Now, I am officially part of the community as a WordPress Developer. What an exciting moment! ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š
The plugin is actually very simple, but it was my first step into the WP community, and I wanted to start from the ground up to quietly join the team.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding for WordPress for over five years, a significant part of my work.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today my plugin was approved</strong>, and it has been published in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-header-and-footer/"><strong>official WordPress repository</strong></a>!
Now, I am officially part of the community as a <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/albertoreineri/"><strong>WordPress Developer</strong></a>.
What an exciting moment! ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>The plugin is actually <strong>very simple</strong>, but it was my first step into the WP community, and I wanted to start from the ground up to quietly join the team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been coding for WordPress for over five years, a significant part of my work. However, obtaining <strong>approval from the official team</strong> is far from simple. The rules are strict, and the code needs a complex structure to be approved, making software development a challenging task. Even though my plugin seems to perform a simple task, behind the scenes, there&rsquo;s a considerable effort to meet the high standards required. Throughout this journey, I&rsquo;ve gained new insights into software design and learned to use the SVN version control system for managing the code and updates for my plugin. As always, <em>doing is the best way to learn!</em></p>
<p>All of this has no monetary value; the plugin is <strong>free &amp; open source</strong>, so it&rsquo;s available for free to anyone worldwide. My reward lies in the pride of creating something that can be useful to others, in addition to being officially recognized as a WP Developer by the official team.</p>
<p>Receiving acknowledgments is always a rewarding experience, especially when they come from such a vast and diverse community like WordPress, which manages one of the most widely used software platforms globally.</p>
<p>For anyone interested, here is the link to the plugin: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-header-and-footer/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-header-and-footer/</a>. I want to emphasize once again that it&rsquo;s a Free &amp; Open Source project, so anyone can participate and improve it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wrap up this self-referential post here, but sometimes being proud of oneself is healthy and necessary to keep enthusiasm high! Also, I can revisit this page in a few years and remember this significant event for me.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

			<title>Never stop learning...</title>

			<description>I began writing code almost ten years ago, using different languages, libraries, and frameworks, but the desire to always learn something new has not yet left me, fortunately.
For the past couple of years, a little word has been wandering in my mind that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to shake off: Python.
If you do a quick search online about programming languages, you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably come across a flood of articles related to this language.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I began writing code almost ten years ago, using different languages, libraries, and frameworks, but the desire to always learn something new has not yet left me, fortunately.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, a little word has been wandering in my mind that I can&rsquo;t seem to shake off: <strong><a href="/en/blog/organizing-work-with-python/">Python</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you do a quick search online about programming languages, you&rsquo;ll inevitably come across a flood of articles related to this language. Almost all discussions and articles revolve around Python and Javascript.</p>
<p>What attracts people to this language is undoubtedly its simple syntax and its use in artificial intelligence and machine learning. So, I think it&rsquo;s time to take a closer look.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve never developed anything in Python</strong> and, therefore, don&rsquo;t know how to use it. I&rsquo;ve read a few things in the documentation, learned the syntax, but I can&rsquo;t say I know how to use it until I create something with this language.</p>
<p>I started with good old Visual Basic, then moved on to ASP, PHP, and Javascript (let&rsquo;s not count HTML and CSS for now&hellip;), and now I believe it&rsquo;s time to learn how to create something with Python too.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-start">WHERE TO START?</h2>
<p>As always when approaching a new language, you never know where to <strong>start</strong>&hellip; And with Python, the possibilities are truly <strong>endless</strong>.</p>
<p>You can create <strong>websites</strong> and web apps, but also <strong>desktop and mobile applications</strong>! Virtually anything.</p>
<p>In theory, I should lean towards web development, so towards using <strong><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/#:~:text=Django%20is%20a%20high%2Dlevel,It's%20free%20and%20open%20source." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django</a></strong>, but I must say that desktop and mobile frameworks also attract me quite a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already installed Django, and from what little I&rsquo;ve seen, I really like it, but <strong>Kivy</strong> also catches my attention&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="im-torn-by-indecision">I&rsquo;M TORN BY INDECISION&hellip;</h2>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;ve already created <strong>a couple of scripts</strong> with Python and <strong>Selenium</strong>, and it was really simple and fast. I was impressed by the <strong>few lines</strong> of code and the <strong>online community</strong>. I found everything I was looking for in a short time and managed to do what I wanted! <strong>What more could I ask for?</strong></p>
<p>I hope that next week I can make up my mind and choose the framework to rely on, which will probably be Django. Maybe I could try to bring some of my PHP projects to <strong>Django</strong> and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Any suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>See you soon</p>
<p><em>Happy coding!</em></p>

			<title>I have developed my own CMS</title>

			<description>WordPress is a fantastic platform, a great CMS that allows managing website content relatively easily and quickly. It offers a vast range of plugins and enables the rapid and effective development of projects.
However, there are a few things in WordPress that I&amp;rsquo;ve never liked&amp;hellip; Two, in particular:
1. SLOWNESS Firstly, the slowness. Even when developing a custom WordPress theme, WordPress introduces dependencies that are inevitable and slow down page loading.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>WordPress</strong> is a fantastic platform, a great CMS that allows managing website content relatively easily and quickly. It offers a vast range of plugins and enables the rapid and effective development of projects.</p>
<p>However, there are a few things in WordPress that <strong>I&rsquo;ve never liked</strong>&hellip; Two, in particular:</p>
<h2 id="1-slowness">1. SLOWNESS</h2>
<p>Firstly, the slowness. Even when developing a <strong>custom WordPress theme</strong>, WordPress introduces <strong>dependencies</strong> that are <strong>inevitable</strong> and slow down page loading.</p>
<p>Additionally, every plugin adds its CSS and JS files to all pages of the site, regardless of whether they are needed only on the homepage or a specific internal page. (This can be mitigated by forgoing plugins and using a completely custom solution, but this extends development time&hellip;)</p>
<p>The same website created with or without WordPress has significantly faster loading times! If you want to run some tests, use these two services, and you&rsquo;ll see that WordPress-developed sites will be slower, even when using more expensive and performant hosting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">https://tools.pingdom.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=IT">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=IT</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For a more comprehensive website test, you can use the tool developed by <a href="https://www.digitale.co/">Digitale.co</a>, allowing scanning multiple pages at once. This way, you can save time and have a better and broader overview of a website&rsquo;s performance! Here&rsquo;s the link to the tool!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitale.co/pagespeed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><a href="https://www.digitale.co/pagespeed">https://www.digitale.co/pagespeed</a></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-the-backend">2. THE BACKEND</h2>
<p>Secondly, the backend is nice and simple, but not always. <strong>The inability to make invasive changes</strong> to the backend has always frustrated me a lot.</p>
<p>Sure, we can create custom posts, custom fields with Advanced Custom Fields, change the backend&rsquo;s color scheme, create a custom login, etc., but we don&rsquo;t have the freedoms of a platform created entirely from scratch, where we can decide everything we want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked feeling like a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; to software, having to obey its laws without the possibility of intervening wherever I want.</p>
<h2 id="my-cms">MY CMS</h2>
<p>For this reason, I created <strong><a href="/orange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange CMS</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I have always loved programming, and using code written by others has never appealed to me. I am a developer, and I want to develop; that&rsquo;s the only way to learn and move forward!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, <strong>I haven&rsquo;t reinvented the wheel</strong>. I used a series of scripts developed in the past and some online libraries, and little by little, I created this platform.</p>
<p>I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ckeditor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CKEditor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CKFinder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datatables.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DataTables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fengyuanchen.github.io/datepicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DatePicker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If I could be effective with WordPress, with Orange CMS, I can say that I am efficient!</p>
<p>Development times are more or less the same, but with Orange CMS, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a data loading system developed specifically for the project&rsquo;s needs, significantly reducing content loading times</li>
<li>create completely customizable and SEO-friendly URLs using a practical <a href="/en/blog/simple-routing-system-in-php">routing system</a></li>
<li>create specific sections for website content</li>
<li>achieve very short loading times</li>
<li>have a secure login with encrypted passwords</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some websites</strong> created with Orange CMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://danzeoccitane.altervista.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">danzeoccitane.altervista.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eventicuneo.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventicuneo.it</a></li>
<li><a href="http://studiomacdesign.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studiomacdesign.it</a></li>
<li><a href="http://associazionefedercasa.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">associazionefedercasa.it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This <strong>doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll stop using WordPress</strong>; for a blog, I believe it&rsquo;s still the best solution, but I think I&rsquo;ll use it less frequently.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this article.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
