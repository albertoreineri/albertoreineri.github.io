			<description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my New Website!
I know, it might seem unconventional. There&amp;rsquo;s no WOW effect as one would expect, at least not in the form of flashy or extravagant animations. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple website, primarily text-based. It might seem like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully comply with Google&amp;rsquo;s rules, but in reality, there&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye.
Why Such an SEO-Unfriendly Website I decided to make a radical change! Originally, this site was the showcase of my Freelance Web Developer business.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s my New Website!</p>
<p>I know, it might seem unconventional. <strong>There&rsquo;s no WOW effect</strong> as one would expect, at least not in the form of flashy or extravagant animations. It&rsquo;s a simple website, primarily text-based. It might seem like <strong>it doesn&rsquo;t fully comply with Google&rsquo;s rules</strong>, but in reality, there&rsquo;s more than meets the eye.</p>
<h2 id="why-such-an-seo-unfriendly-website">Why Such an SEO-Unfriendly Website</h2>
<p>I decided to make a radical change! Originally, this site was the <strong>showcase of my Freelance Web Developer business</strong>. In the past, it had vibrant colors, animations, and effects to showcase my skills and attract new clients.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I no longer need to <em>show off</em> that much. This is for various reasons:</p>
<h3 id="no-economic-need-to-find-new-clients">No economic need to find new clients</h3>
<p>At the moment, I find myself in a rather stable situation (<em>as stable as a VAT business can be&hellip;</em>). I have satisfying long-term collaborations and fill my days with programming. I always welcome new clients and projects, even though I recently had to decline some and direct potential clients to other entities! Being a solo Freelancer, I don&rsquo;t have the structure to expand indefinitely, and honestly, I don&rsquo;t want to create it at the moment. For now, I&rsquo;m content with staying solo. However, this means I have to turn down some work. Days have a limited number of hours, and my mind has a limited number of projects it can handle, so for now, I can say I&rsquo;m saturated.</p>
<p>Perhaps in a few years, I&rsquo;ll open up to new possibilities, or I&rsquo;ll strengthen current collaborations even more and quit freelancing altogether&hellip; Who knows&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see how things evolve! There&rsquo;s no point in looking too far ahead; the world is constantly changing, and we must always be ready to adapt!</p>
<h3 id="i-want-a-website-that-represents-me">I want a website that represents me</h3>
<p>My site must be first and foremost <strong>mine</strong>! It may seem obvious, but today, to <em>attract</em> the audience, you have to appear cool, modern, lively, joyful, and then some! In the past, I did it because it was necessary, but in reality, I&rsquo;m not like that&hellip;
I&rsquo;m a rather serious, calm, and composed person. I love silence and tranquility; I don&rsquo;t like things that are too flashy&hellip;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself boxed in; I&rsquo;ve always had long hair, dressed casually, and I&rsquo;m quite liberal, but I tend to take things seriously, perhaps too much.</p>
<h3 id="showcase">Showcase</h3>
<p>This site is no longer my showcase, or better to say, its being a showcase is no longer a central factor.
For now, the promotional pages <a href="/services">Services</a> and <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a> are still active, but I don&rsquo;t exclude the possibility of removing them in the future and keeping only the blog. Also, I plan to create an Extra section to include what I do outside the web world.</p>
<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>
<p>However, SEO is indeed present on this site. The Lighthouse tests are very positive, and I expect the indexing to improve. It&rsquo;s true that there are no images, but the content is already widely read, and now the loading times have greatly improved. Only time will tell if all this can work.</p>
<h3 id="exiting-social-media">Exiting Social Media</h3>
<p>As a long-term goal, I would like to use this site as my only online presence.
I&rsquo;ve been fed up with social networks for a long time. They are becoming more and more invasive, and every time I think about what they bring to my life, there are more things they take away from me than what they give me. Therefore, I hope to get out of them soon. I&rsquo;m forced to keep them active because I sometimes use them for work, but I hope to close them shortly and be present online only through this site. If it happens, I&rsquo;ll also create an &ldquo;Extra&rdquo; section to gather some of my curiosities outside of programming.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-site-works">How This Site Works</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by saying that this site is developed with Hugo, an open-source framework for creating static sites. This allows me to manage it entirely through GitHub. So, I gave up my personal domain and am using <a href="https://albertoreineri.github.io/">albertoreineri.github.io</a>. The only thing I had to give up is the email associated with my personal domain, so I use Gmail. This has never been a problem for my clients over the years, and it saves me from managing domain, DNS, and server for this site. One less job for me!</p>
<p>But how does this particular site work? Well, it&rsquo;s not actually difficult&hellip;
The main thing is that the navbar is moved down, not at the top like on all other sites. This is to make the site more convenient to use, more app-style. If you open it from mobile, you can use the navbar simply with your thumb without stretching it to the top of the screen, but by clicking comfortably at the bottom.</p>
<p>This site is oriented towards a pleasant reading experience. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s only a dark mode. Reading white text on a dark background is more relaxing for the eyes and stresses the mind less.
Also, the structure presents only text without a sidebar or anything else. Sometimes the table of contents is on the right, always to improve content readability. Finally, on scroll, the navbar disappears completely, and the text becomes the only thing on the page to ensure the best possible reading experience.</p>
<p>Scrolling up or reaching the bottom of the page will make the navbar visible again, and you can change pages.</p>
<p>As additional features, there&rsquo;s the possibility to search the site&rsquo;s content and multilingual support, which is still in development but will be online soon.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is my new site. I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last! As a web developer, I&rsquo;m always looking for new challenges, and the best way to understand a technology is to try it directly. It could be completely different in two months, or I could remain faithful to this approach for years.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ll keep you informed on this blog!</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the vast landscape of software development, effective code management plays a crucial role in determining the success of a project. In this context, Git stands out as an indispensable tool, providing a powerful and efficient version control system. Its adoption not only simplifies collaboration among developers but also offers a robust method for tracking changes over time, managing distinct branches, and resolving conflicts in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>This practical guide aims to walk you through the fundamentals of code management with Git, offering a clear and detailed overview of essential procedures. From the initial installation to advanced collaboration on platforms like GitHub, we will explore step by step how to fully leverage Git&rsquo;s capabilities to enhance your development workflow.</p>
<p>Whether you are a beginner embarking on your software development journey or an experienced professional looking to refine your skills, this guide will accompany you in your Git experience, opening doors to a more organized and collaborative code management world.</p>
<h2 id="1-git-installation">1. Git Installation:</h2>
<p>The first fundamental step in embarking on your journey into code management with Git is installing the tool on your system. Git is a versatile resource and can be installed on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow the corresponding steps for your operating system to ensure a correct installation.</p>
<h3 id="windows">Windows:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visit the official Git website (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>) and download the installer.</li>
<li>Run the downloaded installer, following the installation instructions.</li>
<li>During the installation, make sure to select the option to &ldquo;Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Command Prompt&rdquo; to enable Git usage from the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macos">macOS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are using macOS, it is advisable to use Homebrew for installation. Open the terminal and execute the command:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>brew install git
</code></pre></li>
<li>Wait for the installation to complete.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linux-ubuntu">Linux (Ubuntu):</h3>
<ul>
<li>On Ubuntu-based systems, run the following commands in the terminal:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
</code></pre></li>
<li>Confirm the installation when prompted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Verify the installation by running the command <code>git --version</code> in the terminal. If Git has been installed successfully, the current version will be displayed.</p>
<p>With Git installed on your system, you have opened the door to fully exploiting its code management capabilities. In the following sections, we will explore how to initialize a repository and start tracking changes to your code accurately.</p>
<h2 id="2-creating-a-repository">2. Creating a Repository:</h2>
<p>Now that you have Git installed on your system, the next step is to initialize a Git repository within your project&rsquo;s directory. A repository is essentially a container that will track changes to your code over time. Follow these steps carefully to create your repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Opening the Terminal or Console:</strong> Open the terminal if you are on macOS or Linux, or the console if you are on Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigating to the Project Directory:</strong> Use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to your project&rsquo;s directory. For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd path/to/your/project
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initializing the Repository:</strong> Execute the command <code>git init</code> to initialize a new Git repository in the project directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git init
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Checking Repository Status:</strong> You can use the command <code>git status</code> to check the status of your repository, displaying modified or added files and those ready for commit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You have now successfully created your first Git repository. From this point forward, Git will start tracking changes to your files. In the next step, we will explore how to add files to the repository and record changes through commits.</p>
<h2 id="3-adding-files-to-the-repository">3. Adding Files to the Repository:</h2>
<p>Now that your Git repository has been initialized, it&rsquo;s time to start tracking and recording changes to your files. We will use the <code>git add</code> command to stage files and the <code>git commit</code> command to confirm the changes. Here&rsquo;s how to proceed:</p>
<h3 id="adding-files-to-the-repository">Adding Files to the Repository:</h3>
<p>Use the <code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code> command to add a single file to the so-called &ldquo;staging area,&rdquo; where Git prepares files for the next commit.
<code>bash git add filename.txt </code></p>
<p>If you want to add all modified or new files, you can use the command:
<code>bash git add . </code></p>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> with the actual name of your file.</p>
<h3 id="checking-repository-status">Checking Repository Status:</h3>
<p>You can always check the current status of the repository with the <code>git status</code> command. This will show you the files that have been added to the staging area and those still waiting to be added.
<code>bash git status </code></p>
<h3 id="confirming-changes-with-a-commit">Confirming Changes with a Commit:</h3>
<p>Once you have added the desired files, it&rsquo;s time to make a commit to record the changes in the repository. Use the <code>git commit</code> command followed by a descriptive message:
<code>bash git commit -m &quot;Description of the changes&quot; </code></p>
<p>The commit message should be clear and informative, making it easy to understand the changes made in this specific commit.</p>
<p>You have now officially recorded your first changes in the Git repository. In the next step, we will further explore the concepts of branching, allowing you to work on different development lines in an organized manner.</p>
<h2 id="4-committing-changes">4. Committing Changes:</h2>
<p>After adding the desired files to your repository via the staging area, it&rsquo;s time to make a commit. Commits in Git are like snapshots of your project at a specific moment, and each commit has an associated descriptive message indicating the changes made. Here&rsquo;s how to make a commit:</p>
<h3 id="executing-the-commit">Executing the Commit:</h3>
<p>Use the <code>git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</code> command to officially record the changes in the repository.
<code>bash git commit -m &quot;Implemented authentication system&quot; </code></p>
<p>The commit message should be clear and informative, briefly explaining the changes made in this specific commit.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-commit-history">Viewing Commit History:</h3>
<p>You can view the commit history with the <code>git log</code> command. This will show a list of all commits in the repository, with detailed information on who made the commit, when it was executed, and the associated message.</p>
<h3 id="reverting-to-previous-versions-optional">Reverting to Previous Versions (Optional):</h3>
<p>If you want to go back to a previous version of your project, you can do so using the <code>git checkout &lt;commit ID&gt;</code> or <code>git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command. This allows you to explore your project at a specific state.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-differences-optional">Viewing Differences (Optional):</h3>
<p>You can view differences between versions with the <code>git diff</code> command. This command will show you the changes made between your current working copy and the last recorded version in the repository.</p>
<p>Making regular and descriptive commits is a crucial practice to keep track of changes over time and facilitate collaboration with other developers. In the next section, we will explore the use of branches, allowing you to work on different development lines separately.</p>
<h2 id="5-creating-branches">5. Creating Branches:</h2>
<p>The use of branches in Git allows you to develop different code lines separately, enabling parallel work on different features or fixes without directly impacting the main branch. Let&rsquo;s see how to create and manage branches in Git:</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a New Branch:</h3>
<p>Use the <code>git branch &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command to create a new branch. For example:
<code>bash git branch feature-authentication </code></p>
<p>This creates a new branch named &ldquo;feature-authentication,&rdquo; but you currently remain in your current branch.</p>
<h3 id="switching-between-branches">Switching Between Branches:</h3>
<p>To switch from one branch to another, use the <code>git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command:
```bash
git checkout feature-auth</p>
<p>entication
```</p>
<p>You are now in the &ldquo;feature-authentication&rdquo; branch, and any changes you make will be isolated to this branch.</p>
<h3 id="creating-and-switching-in-one-step">Creating and Switching in One Step:</h3>
<p>You can create a new branch and switch to it in one step using the <code>-b</code> option with the <code>git checkout</code> command:
<code>bash git checkout -b feature-authentication </code></p>
<p>This is a convenient shortcut.</p>
<h3 id="merging-branches">Merging Branches:</h3>
<p>Once you have completed work on a branch, you can merge it back into the main branch (usually &ldquo;master&rdquo; or &ldquo;main&rdquo;). First, switch to the main branch:
<code>bash git checkout main </code>
Then, use the <code>git merge &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command to merge the changes from the specified branch:
<code>bash git merge feature-authentication </code></p>
<p>Git will attempt to automatically merge the changes. If conflicts arise, you will need to resolve them manually.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-branches">Deleting Branches:</h3>
<p>After a branch has been merged and is no longer needed, you can delete it using the <code>git branch -d &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command:
<code>bash git branch -d feature-authentication </code></p>
<p>The branch deletion is subject to confirmation. If the branch contains unmerged changes, use <code>-D</code> instead of <code>-d</code> to force deletion:
<code>bash git branch -D feature-authentication </code></p>
<p>Using branches effectively contributes to a more organized and manageable development process. In the next section, we will explore remote repositories and how to collaborate with others using platforms like GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="6-remote-repositories">6. Remote Repositories:</h2>
<p>Git&rsquo;s true power is revealed when collaborating with others on a project. Remote repositories, often hosted on platforms like GitHub, allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase seamlessly. Let&rsquo;s explore the key concepts of remote repositories:</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-remote-repository-github-example">Setting Up a Remote Repository (GitHub Example):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a GitHub account if you don&rsquo;t have one.</li>
<li>On GitHub, click the &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign in the top right and select &ldquo;New repository.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Fill in the repository name, description, and other details.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Create repository.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="linking-a-local-repository-to-a-remote-repository">Linking a Local Repository to a Remote Repository:</h3>
<p>Use the <code>git remote add origin &lt;repository URL&gt;</code> command to link your local repository to a remote repository. For example:
<code>bash git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git </code></p>
<p>Replace the URL with the actual URL of your remote repository.</p>
<h3 id="pushing-changes-to-the-remote-repository">Pushing Changes to the Remote Repository:</h3>
<p>After making changes and committing them locally, use the <code>git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command to push the changes to the remote repository. For example:
<code>bash git push origin main </code></p>
<p>This command pushes the changes made in your local &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch to the &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch of the remote repository.</p>
<h3 id="pulling-changes-from-the-remote-repository">Pulling Changes from the Remote Repository:</h3>
<p>If others have made changes to the remote repository, you can pull those changes to your local repository using the <code>git pull origin &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command. For example:
<code>bash git pull origin main </code></p>
<p>This command fetches the changes made by others in the remote &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch and merges them into your local &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch.</p>
<h3 id="cloning-a-remote-repository">Cloning a Remote Repository:</h3>
<p>To clone an existing remote repository to your local machine, use the <code>git clone &lt;repository URL&gt;</code> command. For example:
<code>bash git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git </code></p>
<p>This creates a copy of the remote repository on your local machine.</p>
<h3 id="branching-in-remote-repositories">Branching in Remote Repositories:</h3>
<p>Branches created in a local repository can be pushed to the remote repository to facilitate collaboration. After creating and committing changes in a local branch, use the <code>git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;</code> command to push the branch to the remote repository.</p>
<p>These fundamental concepts of remote repositories lay the groundwork for effective collaboration among developers. In the final section, we will explore some advanced Git topics, providing additional tools for managing your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="7-advanced-git-topics">7. Advanced Git Topics:</h2>
<h3 id="resolving-merge-conflicts">Resolving Merge Conflicts:</h3>
<p>In collaborative projects, it&rsquo;s common for multiple developers to make changes to the same file simultaneously, leading to merge conflicts. When Git is unable to automatically merge changes, it marks the conflicting sections, and manual intervention is required.</p>
<p>To resolve a merge conflict:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the conflicted file in your code editor.</li>
<li>Locate and resolve the conflicting sections.</li>
<li>Mark the conflict as resolved using <code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Complete the merge with <code>git commit</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="git-rebase">Git Rebase:</h3>
<p>Git rebase is an alternative to merging that allows you to combine multiple branches more linearly. It involves moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.</p>
<p>To rebase a branch:
<code>bash git checkout feature-branch git rebase main </code></p>
<p>This moves the changes in the &ldquo;feature-branch&rdquo; on top of the latest changes in the &ldquo;main&rdquo; branch.</p>
<h3 id="git-tags">Git Tags:</h3>
<p>Git tags are used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (e.g., v1.0.0). Tags are often used for release management.</p>
<p>To create a tag:
<code>bash git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &quot;Version 1.0.0&quot; </code></p>
<p>This creates an annotated tag with a message.</p>
<h3 id="git-stash">Git Stash:</h3>
<p>Git stash allows you to temporarily save changes without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch branches but don&rsquo;t want to commit changes.</p>
<p>To stash changes:
<code>bash git stash </code></p>
<p>Later, you can apply the stashed changes:
<code>bash git stash apply </code></p>
<p>This is particularly helpful when you need to switch to another branch to work on a different task.</p>
<p>These advanced Git topics provide additional tools for managing complex development scenarios. Mastering these concepts will empower you to navigate diverse challenges and contribute effectively to collaborative software projects.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You have completed this comprehensive guide to Git, covering fundamental concepts and advanced topics alike. By mastering Git, you have acquired a powerful skill set that will serve you well in your software development journey.</p>
<p>As you continue your exploration of Git, remember that practice is key. Experiment with different Git commands, collaborate with others on projects, and explore the wide range of possibilities that Git offers for efficient code management.</p>
<p>May your Git repositories always be well-organized, and your commits be descriptive and meaningful. Happy coding!</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today my plugin was approved</strong>, and it has been published in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-header-and-footer/"><strong>official WordPress repository</strong></a>!
Now, I am officially part of the community as a <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/albertoreineri/"><strong>WordPress Developer</strong></a>.
What an exciting moment! 😊 😊 😊</p>
<p>The plugin is actually <strong>very simple</strong>, but it was my first step into the WP community, and I wanted to start from the ground up to quietly join the team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been coding for WordPress for over five years, a significant part of my work. However, obtaining <strong>approval from the official team</strong> is far from simple. The rules are strict, and the code needs a complex structure to be approved, making software development a challenging task. Even though my plugin seems to perform a simple task, behind the scenes, there&rsquo;s a considerable effort to meet the high standards required. Throughout this journey, I&rsquo;ve gained new insights into software design and learned to use the SVN version control system for managing the code and updates for my plugin. As always, <em>doing is the best way to learn!</em></p>
<p>All of this has no monetary value; the plugin is <strong>free &amp; open source</strong>, so it&rsquo;s available for free to anyone worldwide. My reward lies in the pride of creating something that can be useful to others, in addition to being officially recognized as a WP Developer by the official team.</p>
<p>Receiving acknowledgments is always a rewarding experience, especially when they come from such a vast and diverse community like WordPress, which manages one of the most widely used software platforms globally.</p>
<p>For anyone interested, here is the link to the plugin: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-header-and-footer/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-header-and-footer/</a>. I want to emphasize once again that it&rsquo;s a Free &amp; Open Source project, so anyone can participate and improve it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wrap up this self-referential post here, but sometimes being proud of oneself is healthy and necessary to keep enthusiasm high! Also, I can revisit this page in a few years and remember this significant event for me.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

			<description>Would you like to execute PHP code without refreshing the page? With AJAX, you can do it!
An AJAX call is an asynchronous request sent from a web browser to a web server, using the JavaScript language. The web server can respond to the AJAX call with data in JSON, XML, or HTML format, which can then be processed by the web browser to dynamically update a part of the web page without having to reload the entire page.</description>

We will create a real-world example to make the operation clearer, so we&amp;rsquo;ll build a Contact Form using Bootstrap and then send an email upon submitting the form.

</div>

<p>The <strong>ability to choose our URLs</strong> is crucial for creating a good website. By using PHP pages correctly, you can easily achieve this result by simply hiding the extension from the URL.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will see how to <strong>&ldquo;remove&rdquo; the .php</strong> at the end of the URL.</p>
<p>To do this, simply <strong>insert the following code into the .htaccess file</strong> in the root of the site. If the .htaccess file does not exist, create it using a text editor.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache"><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteEngine <span style="color:#66d9ef">on</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.php [NC]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.php [NC,L]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This way, all your &ldquo;.php&rdquo; files will be displayed without an extension.</p>
<p>By doing this, the entire site will be better. The addresses will be much more &ldquo;SEO friendly,&rdquo; and the website&rsquo;s security will also benefit.</p>
<p>If you look at the modern websites of large companies, hardly anyone uses the extension at the end of the URL anymore.</p>
<p>Today, we can also use frameworks that allow us to manage URLs in a completely customized and optimal way, but we don&rsquo;t always need an entire framework. Often, for small projects, it&rsquo;s worth doing things from scratch, and in these cases, just a few lines of code in the .htaccess file can easily hide the extension from the URL.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to use a simple routing system to organize the website in the best way and manage your URLs effectively, read this <a href="/en/blog/simple-routing-system-in-php/">article</a>. It&rsquo;s very basic and simple but can be used for small projects without big demands. Of course, it has nothing to do with the routing of <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, for example, but it can be a good starting point to improve your skills.</p>

			<title>WordPress Starter Theme</title>

			<description>After using WordPress for various projects, I decided to create and share my starter theme.
With this project, you can start from a pre-made base and speed up the development time for a new theme from scratch.
The theme already includes:
bootstrap font awesome back on top Developing themes from scratch allows for highly customized results, providing almost total customization, optimization of loading times, and increased site security, provided you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>

<p>With this project, you can start from a pre-made base and speed up the development time for a new theme from scratch.</p>
<p>The theme already includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>bootstrap</li>
<li>font awesome</li>

</ul>
<p>Developing themes from scratch allows for highly customized results, providing almost total customization, optimization of loading times, and increased site security, provided you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<h2 id="no-pre-made-themes">No pre-made themes</h2>
<p>This is entirely my personal opinion, and it may be shared or not.</p>
<p>Personally, I have never felt comfortable with pre-made themes available on platforms like Themeforest or similar. There&rsquo;s always something I want to do but can&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I prefer to start from scratch and have complete control over everything, be able to move as I want, take charge of problems, and solve them in what I think is the best way.</p>
<p>After all, I&rsquo;m a developer, and I don&rsquo;t like drag and drop much&hellip; I prefer code!</p>
<p>But starting from scratch every time can be heavy, boring, and a waste of time. So I created a starter theme, a basic WordPress theme that already includes all the necessary layouts, some libraries, the search form, and other small things that allow me to start working on the fun part of the site immediately.</p>
<p>This way, I don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch every time; I already have a working skeleton ready to be used.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-starter-theme-for-wordpress">Open Source Starter Theme for WordPress</h2>
<p>After creating the Orange Starter Theme for WordPress and successfully using it on many websites, I decided to make it <a href="https://github.com/albertoreineri/orange-starter-theme">open source</a>, so it can be used and expanded by anyone.</p>
<p>Any possible bugs can be reported to me via <a href="https://github.com/albertoreineri/orange-starter-theme">GitHub</a> or directly through the contact form on this site; I will take care of the problem and solve it as quickly as possible.</p>

			<description>Not long ago, I wrote an article praising Git, a version control software I can&amp;rsquo;t live without. So, I decided to create a guide to explain how to use GIT!
BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY USE GIT? IS IT HARD TO USE? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the fact that &amp;ldquo;Git&amp;rdquo; can be translated as &amp;ldquo;idiot,&amp;rdquo; almost suggesting that it&amp;rsquo;s foolproof&amp;hellip;
Jokes aside, it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to use, and it can also be a good starting point to learn the Command Line Interface (CLI)!</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, I wrote an <a href="/en/blog/git-what-is-it/">article</a> praising <strong>Git</strong>, a version control software I can&rsquo;t live without. So, I decided to create a guide to explain how to use GIT!</p>
<h2 id="but-how-do-you-actually-use-git-is-it-hard-to-use">BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY USE GIT? IS IT HARD TO USE?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the fact that &ldquo;Git&rdquo; can be translated as &ldquo;<em>idiot</em>,&rdquo; almost suggesting that it&rsquo;s foolproof&hellip;</p>
<p>Jokes aside, it&rsquo;s <strong>very simple</strong> to use, and it can also be a good <strong>starting point to learn the Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="installation">INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>To <strong>download</strong> Git, simply visit this site: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a></p>
<p>Once you open the link, click on &ldquo;Download,&rdquo; select your operating system, and proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Windows, I recommend installing Git Bash, a nice CLI that I use for many tasks.</p>
<h2 id="usage">USAGE</h2>
<p>Once Git is installed, open Git Bash and navigate to your project folder (use the <code>cd</code> command. E.g., <code>cd C:/Users/alby/projects/app</code>).</p>
<p>Here, enter the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git init
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Git will now be present in your project with a hidden folder called .git. Never open this folder; just leave it where it is; it won&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>Now, on Git Bash, type the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This <strong>adds</strong> all project files to the staging area, waiting to be approved.</p>
<p>Then, simply write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;commit name&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command <strong>commits</strong> your files, creating a version of your project. In quotes, you can write something like &ldquo;First commit,&rdquo; and in subsequent commits, you&rsquo;ll specify the changes made (e.g., &ldquo;Added login&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 id="github">GITHUB</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to save commits on GitHub, allowing you to view and download them from anywhere. It also enables other developers to view and improve your code!</p>
<p>To do this, you need a GitHub account and create a new repository.</p>
<p>After creating a new GitHub repository, GitHub already provides the commands to &ldquo;fill&rdquo; it with your local project.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to enter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git remote add origin https://github.com<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>repository link<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push -u origin master
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This way, your project is now on GitHub. To download it, use the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git pull https://github.com<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>repository link<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These are the <strong>basic commands</strong>. Once a commit is created, you can make further changes to the project and re-run the add and commit commands.</p>
<p>There are <strong>many other commands</strong> to use this software. <strong>The best way to learn them all is to use them</strong>, so get your hands dirty and try them! <strong>You won&rsquo;t be able to do without them</strong>.</p>
<p>Below, I list some of the <strong>most used commands</strong>, explained briefly.</p>

			<title>Windows VS Mac for Web Development: My Experience</title>

			<description>Today, I want to share my experience using these two operating systems, the eternal battle between Windows and Mac. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss it from both a developer&amp;rsquo;s and an average user&amp;rsquo;s perspective since I use the computer for work and leisure, for programming, answering emails, writing documents, scheduling appointments, and more.
During my ten years of programming, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to use both Windows and Mac, each for several years. I&amp;rsquo;ve reached my conclusion, which is somewhat contrary to the usual discussions on various forums and social media in the industry.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I want to share <strong>my experience</strong> using these two operating systems, the eternal battle between Windows and Mac. I&rsquo;ll discuss it from both a developer&rsquo;s and an average user&rsquo;s perspective since I use the computer for work and leisure, for programming, answering emails, writing documents, scheduling appointments, and more.</p>
<p>During my ten years of programming, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to use <strong>both Windows and Mac</strong>, each for several years. I&rsquo;ve reached <strong>my conclusion</strong>, which is somewhat contrary to the usual discussions on various forums and social media in the industry.</p>
<h2 id="my-early-years">MY EARLY YEARS</h2>
<p>I <strong>started</strong> my career as a <strong>vb.net programmer</strong>, so I was using a <strong>Windows</strong> PC by necessity. It was a somewhat worn-out desktop running Windows <strong>XP</strong>. I must say, <strong>I didn&rsquo;t find it bad at all</strong>. Developing management software, the clients in 99.9% of cases had a Windows PC (there were very few Apple products around at that time, at least in my area), and thus the program had to run on that operating system. Those first four years of programming made me appreciate the operating system of good old Bill Gates. I got to <strong>know practically all keyboard shortcuts</strong> and customization options available. I could be very fast with my PC, and <strong>I knew my work environment perfectly</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="macbook-white">MACBOOK WHITE</h2>
<p>Then, more out of curiosity, I <strong>bought</strong> a Mac, specifically the <strong>Macbook White</strong>. Beautiful! <strong>Aesthetically, it had no comparison</strong> with the competition. A completely white PC, without designs, patterns, without anything superfluous.</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s when my journey into the Apple world began</strong>. And it went well.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, Mac easily won, plus it had a program I loved and used a lot: Garageband! The simplicity of that software was terrific! I could record decently even without an audio interface, without any lag, and the default effects were fantastic! Unfortunately, I never found anything like it on Windows&hellip;</p>
<p>But there was always <strong>something that didn&rsquo;t sit right with me&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>It was beautiful, the battery seemed infinite, it was smooth and fast, but <strong>too closed!</strong> Perhaps it&rsquo;s predictable, but being a closed system didn&rsquo;t appeal to me at all!</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve always been a tinkerer.</strong> As soon as I get my hands on any machine, I have to understand how it works, how to make it work better, and how to play around with it. And with the Mac, I couldn&rsquo;t do much&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="issues">ISSUES</h2>
<p>And here we come to the heart of the Windows VS Mac battle.</p>
<p>The first problem was the <strong>Office suite</strong>. At that time, the only alternative was OpenOffice, but compatibility was not 100%. Sometimes, opening a Word file would result in completely messed-up formatting&hellip; and that bothered me a lot. Of course, I could have bought Office for Mac, but I didn&rsquo;t want to&hellip; (OK? :))</p>
<p>Then, on the <strong>programming</strong> side, I felt a bit stuck. While Visual Basic is a very basic language, it was the one I knew at the time, and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything with my Mac. I had installed Windows on a virtual machine, but it was very slow, and I couldn&rsquo;t work properly&hellip;</p>
<p>Even web development wasn&rsquo;t that straightforward for me! I used <strong>XAMPP</strong>, and at that time, I remember there was no XAMPP for Mac. So, I had downloaded MAMP, but I didn&rsquo;t like it much&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>I couldn&rsquo;t play games</strong>&hellip; and even though I was never a hardcore gamer, occasionally launching a simple game to relax wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I felt restricted. If with Windows, I could do whatever I wanted, install anything, modify, experiment until I had to format the computer because of all the mess I had created, with the Mac, I could do almost nothing&hellip; Sure, I avoided creating messes, but I liked it!</p>
<h2 id="back-to-windows">BACK TO WINDOWS</h2>
<p>After 6 years, I had to change the PC; <strong>the little Macbook White couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore</strong>, and I returned to Windows.</p>
<p>That time in the Windows Vs Mac battle, Windows won.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>Mac prices are truly prohibitive</strong>&hellip; My Macbook White started at a price of €1000, and I remember getting it on sale at Euronics for €800. Those were still acceptable figures for a PC with 500GB HDD and 4GB RAM at that time.</p>
<p>Now, if you want a base model, you have to spend <strong>almost twice as much</strong>, for just 128GB of storage, a truly ridiculous amount, and without having USB, SD, and HDMI ports, which I still find fundamentally important.</p>
<p><strong>So, I went back to Windows, and I must say I&rsquo;m thrilled!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can truly do everything!</strong> I immediately started tinkering again, and after two weeks, I had to format the PC because I had installed a bunch of nonsense, but I was happy! That&rsquo;s how I like to live with my PC; I want to be the one deciding how to make it work!</p>
<p>Now I can <strong>program</strong>, <strong>record</strong> music, <strong>play games</strong>, <strong>write</strong>, <strong>edit</strong> videos, use <strong>virtual machines</strong>, etc., without any slowdowns. Spending less than on a Macbook, I got a Core i7 with 16GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD, and a 4GB graphics card! Basically, a powerhouse, for less than €100</p>

			<description>I began writing code almost ten years ago, using different languages, libraries, and frameworks, but the desire to always learn something new has not yet left me, fortunately.
For the past couple of years, a little word has been wandering in my mind that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to shake off: Python.
If you do a quick search online about programming languages, you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably come across a flood of articles related to this language.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I began writing code almost ten years ago, using different languages, libraries, and frameworks, but the desire to always learn something new has not yet left me, fortunately.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, a little word has been wandering in my mind that I can&rsquo;t seem to shake off: <strong><a href="/en/blog/organizing-work-with-python/">Python</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you do a quick search online about programming languages, you&rsquo;ll inevitably come across a flood of articles related to this language. Almost all discussions and articles revolve around Python and Javascript.</p>
<p>What attracts people to this language is undoubtedly its simple syntax and its use in artificial intelligence and machine learning. So, I think it&rsquo;s time to take a closer look.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve never developed anything in Python</strong> and, therefore, don&rsquo;t know how to use it. I&rsquo;ve read a few things in the documentation, learned the syntax, but I can&rsquo;t say I know how to use it until I create something with this language.</p>
<p>I started with good old Visual Basic, then moved on to ASP, PHP, and Javascript (let&rsquo;s not count HTML and CSS for now&hellip;), and now I believe it&rsquo;s time to learn how to create something with Python too.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-start">WHERE TO START?</h2>
<p>As always when approaching a new language, you never know where to <strong>start</strong>&hellip; And with Python, the possibilities are truly <strong>endless</strong>.</p>
<p>You can create <strong>websites</strong> and web apps, but also <strong>desktop and mobile applications</strong>! Virtually anything.</p>
<p>In theory, I should lean towards web development, so towards using <strong><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/#:~:text=Django%20is%20a%20high%2Dlevel,It's%20free%20and%20open%20source." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django</a></strong>, but I must say that desktop and mobile frameworks also attract me quite a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already installed Django, and from what little I&rsquo;ve seen, I really like it, but <strong>Kivy</strong> also catches my attention&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="im-torn-by-indecision">I&rsquo;M TORN BY INDECISION&hellip;</h2>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;ve already created <strong>a couple of scripts</strong> with Python and <strong>Selenium</strong>, and it was really simple and fast. I was impressed by the <strong>few lines</strong> of code and the <strong>online community</strong>. I found everything I was looking for in a short time and managed to do what I wanted! <strong>What more could I ask for?</strong></p>
<p>I hope that next week I can make up my mind and choose the framework to rely on, which will probably be Django. Maybe I could try to bring some of my PHP projects to <strong>Django</strong> and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Any suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>See you soon</p>
<p><em>Happy coding!</em></p>

<p>Do you want to remove the &ldquo;not secure&rdquo; label that appears next to your site&rsquo;s URL? Then this article is for you!</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t delve into what HTTPS is, but we&rsquo;ll simply see how to make your site work securely.</p>
<p>The procedure is very simple; you just need to follow these two steps:</p>
<h2 id="1-enable-ssl-on-your-web-space">1. Enable SSL on your web space</h2>
<p>Access the control panel of your hosting service and look for &ldquo;Enable HTTPS,&rdquo; &ldquo;Enable SSL,&rdquo; or something similar (varies depending on the service).</p>
<p>Once you find the right section, activate the service. It may take a few hours before it becomes active.</p>
<p>After a few hours, try accessing your site by typing <a href="https://www.yourwebsite.com">https://www.yourwebsite.com</a>. If everything works correctly, proceed to step 2.</p>
<p>If you encounter any errors, it&rsquo;s likely because you have HTTP links for stylesheets, images, and JS files. Try replacing &ldquo;http&rdquo; with &ldquo;https&rdquo; in all references to images, CSS, and JS; this should fix everything.</p>
<p>If you use <a href="/blog/how-to-install-and-customize-a-wordpress-theme-2/">WordPress</a>, you can use plugins that address the issue, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/">Really Simple SSL</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-ssl/">WP Force SSL</a>. By using these plugins, you can skip step 2, as the plugins handle everything automatically.</p>
<h2 id="2-redirect-traffic-to-https">2. REDIRECT TRAFFIC TO HTTPS</h2>
<p>If you have completed step one correctly, you can now open the .htaccess file in the root of your site (create it if it doesn&rsquo;t exist) and insert the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache"><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteEngine <span style="color:#66d9ef">on</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This way, all server calls will be redirected to HTTPS.</p>
<p>If this code creates an error regarding redirects, you can replace:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache"><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache"><span style="display:flex;"><span>RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With these simple steps, you can install an SSL certificate and redirect traffic from HTTP to HTTPS, making your website more secure.</p>

			<title>SASS Tutorial - What is it and why you won&#39;t be able to do without it</title>

			<description>&amp;ldquo;If you live in the world of web development, then you have probably heard of SASS, the most famous CSS preprocessor! This is a fantastic tool that allows you to significantly extend the capabilities of CSS and create and manage stylesheets in a fast and organized manner.
SASS is a CSS preprocessor that adds special features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and much more to regular CSS. The goal is to make the process of creating CSS simple and effective, both to write and to read in the future.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;If you live in the world of web development, then you have probably heard of SASS, the most famous CSS preprocessor! This is a fantastic tool that allows you to significantly extend the capabilities of CSS and create and manage stylesheets in a fast and organized manner.</p>
<p>SASS is a CSS preprocessor that adds special features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and much more to regular CSS. The goal is to make the process of creating CSS simple and effective, both to write and to read in the future.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s delve a bit deeper!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-css-preprocessor">What is a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
<p>A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS, allowing developers to write code in a specific language and then compile it into CSS. Sass is perhaps the most popular preprocessor currently in use, but other well-known examples include Less and Stylus.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, a quick note is needed: most web designers would say that if you are new to CSS, it&rsquo;s better to avoid Sass (or any preprocessors, extensions, or frameworks) while you are still learning. Although these tools offer many advantages in terms of speed and efficiency, it&rsquo;s important to thoroughly understand the basics of CSS before exploring various tools. Make sure to learn the key concepts before delving into the available tools. This applies to every technology and framework; it&rsquo;s always a good practice to learn the base language thoroughly before moving on to the built tools!</p>
<p>Now, back to Sass!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-sass">What is Sass?</h2>
<p>Sass (which stands for &ldquo;Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets&rdquo;) is an extension of CSS that allows you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports, and more. It also helps keep code organized and enables you to create stylesheets much faster.</p>
<p>Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement to use it is to have Ruby installed. Developers using it are also encouraged to follow the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/community-guidelines">Sass Community Guidelines</a>, it&rsquo;s always good to take a look.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-sass">How to Use Sass?</h2>
<p>In the following section, we&rsquo;ll look at some basic tips for using Sass, using examples from the official Sass website. Check the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation">official documentation</a> for further references and examples.</p>
<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
<p>Sass includes two syntax options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SCSS (Sassy CSS):</strong> Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax. (My favorite!)</li>
<li><strong>SASS:</strong> Uses indentation instead of braces and has the .sass extension; it&rsquo;s not entirely compliant with CSS syntax, but it&rsquo;s faster to write. (For Python lovers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Files can be converted from one syntax to another using the <code>sass-convert</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Just like other programming languages, Sass allows the use of variables that can store information used throughout the stylesheet.</p>
<p>For example, you can store a color value in a variable at the top of the file and then use this variable when setting the color of your elements. This allows you to quickly change colors without modifying each line separately.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$font-stack<span style="color:#f92672">:</span> Helvetica<span style="color:#f92672">,</span> sans-serif;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$primary-color<span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">#333</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code will generate the following CSS:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="nesting">Nesting</h3>
<p>Nesting is a double-edged sword. While it provides an excellent method to reduce the amount of code to write, it can also lead to overly messy CSS if not done carefully.</p>
<p>The idea is to nest CSS selectors to mimic HTML hierarchy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a navigation menu using nesting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">nav</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">ul</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">margin</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The output CSS will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">nav</span> <span style="color:#f92672">ul</span> {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="partials">Partials</h3>
<p>Partials are smaller Sass files that can be imported (see the next section) into other Sass files. They act like code snippets. With these snippets, CSS can be modular and easier to maintain. A partial is designated as such by naming it with an initial underscore: <code>_partial.scss</code>.</p>
<h3 id="import">Import</h3>
<p>Used with partials (see the previous section), the <code>@import</code> command allows you to import partial files into the current file, creating a single CSS file. This way, during development, you can divide the code into sections, while during site loading, there will be only one CSS file to load, reducing the server request.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<p><strong>_reset.scss</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">html</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Important:</strong> When importing partials, there is no need to include the file extension or the underscore.</p>
<h3 id="mixins">Mixins</h3>
<p>One of the advantages of using preprocessors is the ability to take complex and complicated code and simplify it. This is where</p>
<p>mixins come in handy!</p>
<p>For example, if you need to include vendor prefixes, you can use a mixin. Take a look at this example for border-radius:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">@mixin</span><span style="color:#a6e22e"> border-radius</span>($radius) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">-webkit-border-radius</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> $radius;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     <span style="color:#a6e22e">-moz-border-radius</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> $radius;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#a6e22e">-ms-border-radius</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> $radius;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>          <span style="color:#a6e22e">border-radius</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> $radius;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">.box</span> { <span style="color:#66d9ef">@include</span><span style="color:#a6e22e"> border-radius</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>); }
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note: The <code>@mixin</code> command is at the top. It is named &ldquo;border-radius&rdquo; and the variable &ldquo;$radius&rdquo; is given as a parameter. This variable is used to set the radius value for each element.</p>
<p>Then, the <code>@include</code> command is called, along with the mixin name (&ldquo;border-radius&rdquo;) and a parameter (10px). Therefore, <code>.box {@include border-radius (10px);}</code>.</p>
<p><strong>It produces the following CSS:</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">box</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-webkit-</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">border-radius</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-moz-</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">border-radius</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-ms-</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">border-radius</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">border-radius</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="extend">Extend</h3>
<p>The <code>@extend</code> command has been defined as one of the most powerful features of Sass. After seeing it in action, it&rsquo;s clear why.</p>
<p>The idea is that with this directive, you won&rsquo;t have to include more class names in your HTML elements, and you can keep your code DRY (Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself). Selectors can inherit styles from other selectors and thus be easily extended when needed.</p>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p>The ability to perform calculations in CSS allows for expanded possibilities, such as converting pixel values to percentages. You can access standard mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Of course, these functions can be combined to create complex calculations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sass includes some built-in functions to help manipulate numbers. Functions like <code>percentage()</code>, <code>floor()</code>, and <code>round()</code> to name a few.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know about this tool before, start using it in your current project; you&rsquo;ll surely not regret it!</p>
<p>If you already knew about it, I hope I may have revealed some additional features of this fantastic tool!</p>
<p>Happy coding!&rdquo;</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>WordPress</strong> is a fantastic platform, a great CMS that allows managing website content relatively easily and quickly. It offers a vast range of plugins and enables the rapid and effective development of projects.</p>
<p>However, there are a few things in WordPress that <strong>I&rsquo;ve never liked</strong>&hellip; Two, in particular:</p>
<h2 id="1-slowness">1. SLOWNESS</h2>
<p>Firstly, the slowness. Even when developing a <strong>custom WordPress theme</strong>, WordPress introduces <strong>dependencies</strong> that are <strong>inevitable</strong> and slow down page loading.</p>
<p>Additionally, every plugin adds its CSS and JS files to all pages of the site, regardless of whether they are needed only on the homepage or a specific internal page. (This can be mitigated by forgoing plugins and using a completely custom solution, but this extends development time&hellip;)</p>
<p>The same website created with or without WordPress has significantly faster loading times! If you want to run some tests, use these two services, and you&rsquo;ll see that WordPress-developed sites will be slower, even when using more expensive and performant hosting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">https://tools.pingdom.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=IT">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=IT</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For a more comprehensive website test, you can use the tool developed by <a href="https://www.digitale.co/">Digitale.co</a>, allowing scanning multiple pages at once. This way, you can save time and have a better and broader overview of a website&rsquo;s performance! Here&rsquo;s the link to the tool!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitale.co/pagespeed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><a href="https://www.digitale.co/pagespeed">https://www.digitale.co/pagespeed</a></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-the-backend">2. THE BACKEND</h2>
<p>Secondly, the backend is nice and simple, but not always. <strong>The inability to make invasive changes</strong> to the backend has always frustrated me a lot.</p>
<p>Sure, we can create custom posts, custom fields with Advanced Custom Fields, change the backend&rsquo;s color scheme, create a custom login, etc., but we don&rsquo;t have the freedoms of a platform created entirely from scratch, where we can decide everything we want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked feeling like a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; to software, having to obey its laws without the possibility of intervening wherever I want.</p>
<h2 id="my-cms">MY CMS</h2>
<p>For this reason, I created <strong><a href="/orange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange CMS</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I have always loved programming, and using code written by others has never appealed to me. I am a developer, and I want to develop; that&rsquo;s the only way to learn and move forward!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, <strong>I haven&rsquo;t reinvented the wheel</strong>. I used a series of scripts developed in the past and some online libraries, and little by little, I created this platform.</p>
<p>I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ckeditor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CKEditor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CKFinder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datatables.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DataTables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fengyuanchen.github.io/datepicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DatePicker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If I could be effective with WordPress, with Orange CMS, I can say that I am efficient!</p>
<p>Development times are more or less the same, but with Orange CMS, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a data loading system developed specifically for the project&rsquo;s needs, significantly reducing content loading times</li>
<li>create completely customizable and SEO-friendly URLs using a practical <a href="/en/blog/simple-routing-system-in-php">routing system</a></li>
<li>create specific sections for website content</li>
<li>achieve very short loading times</li>
<li>have a secure login with encrypted passwords</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some websites</strong> created with Orange CMS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://danzeoccitane.altervista.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">danzeoccitane.altervista.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eventicuneo.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventicuneo.it</a></li>
<li><a href="http://studiomacdesign.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studiomacdesign.it</a></li>
<li><a href="http://associazionefedercasa.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">associazionefedercasa.it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This <strong>doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll stop using WordPress</strong>; for a blog, I believe it&rsquo;s still the best solution, but I think I&rsquo;ll use it less frequently.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this article.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

WordPress is the world&amp;rsquo;s most widely used platform for creating websites, but it often happens that it is used in a non-optimal way.
This can cause serious slowdowns on the site.
WordPress, while fantastic, comes with a somewhat heavy core of its own, and if you install themes and plugins left and right, it will soon become extremely slow, not only damaging the user experience but also affecting SEO indexing.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Do you have a slow WordPress site? Does it frequently freeze, leaving you frustrated just by looking at it? Let&rsquo;s see how to improve it!</p>
<p>WordPress is <strong>the world&rsquo;s most widely used platform</strong> for creating websites, but it often happens that it is used in a non-optimal way.</p>
<p>This can cause <strong>serious slowdowns</strong> on the site.</p>
<p>WordPress, while fantastic, comes with a somewhat <strong>heavy core</strong> of its own, and if you install themes and plugins <strong>left and right</strong>, it will soon become <strong>extremely slow</strong>, not only damaging the user experience but also affecting SEO indexing.</p>
<h2 id="what-slows-down-your-wordpress-site">What Slows Down Your WordPress Site?</h2>
<p>The reasons your WordPress site is slow can be <strong>varied</strong>. Here are the main causes listed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Hosting</strong>: If the web hosting server is not configured correctly or is of poor quality, the site will undoubtedly be affected. You can have a perfectly developed site, but if the server it runs on is not optimized, the results will be poor.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress Configuration</strong>: If your site does not offer cache storage, it can overload the server, causing slowdowns or site crashes.</li>
<li><strong>Image Size</strong>: One of the major causes of slowdowns is huge images. Many large images on the same page will significantly slow down loading times.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Quality Plugins</strong>: Using plugins with errors, incorrect code, or unnecessary features will undoubtedly result in slowdowns, if not security issues.</li>
<li><strong>External Scripts</strong>: All various scripts external to the site, such as ads, fonts, tracking systems, etc., will slow down the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go into more detail.</p>
<h2 id="having-good-hosting-makes-a-difference">Having Good Hosting Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>Hosting is <strong>the foundation on which your site is built</strong>. If the foundations are not of quality, no matter how perfect what is built on them is, it will undoubtedly be destined to <strong>collapse</strong>.</p>
<p>Having good hosting service, with <strong>state-of-the-art features</strong> and 24/7 support, allows you to sleep soundly, have everything under control, and be <strong>sure</strong> that the site will run correctly at all times.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, you can have a perfectly developed site, fully optimized, with images of the right size, scripts loaded correctly, everything perfect. <strong>But if the hosting is not good, this site will still perform poorly.</strong></p>
<p>I have already created a custom theme from scratch, spending many hours optimizing each server request so as not to overload it as much as possible, and then get poor results in performance tests. This is very frustrating and <strong>harmful</strong> to the website.</p>
<p>You need to rely on true professionals who can <strong>choose the best service based on your needs</strong>.</p>
<p>There is no perfect hosting always; you need to <strong>evaluate the needs</strong> and choose accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="wordpress-configuration">WordPress Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="cache">Cache</h3>
<p>It is possible to speed up a slow WordPress site quickly and easily by installing a plugin for <strong>cache management</strong>.</p>
<p>There are many, even free ones, but it is necessary to know how to <strong>configure them correctly</strong>.</p>
<p>You can get good results by using the default configurations of the plugin, but by setting <strong>each parameter individually</strong> based on the site, <strong>performance will increase significantly</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>Another best practice is always to keep the site updated. Not updating is also risky from a security standpoint, so <strong>always ensure that your site is up to date, as well as various plugins.</strong></p>
<h2 id="optimize-images">Optimize Images</h2>
<p>Having many images is one of the first causes of a slow WordPress site.</p>
<p>However, the solution is not to remove them all and have pages with only text. Fortunately, there are many tools that can <strong>optimize images</strong> for the web.</p>
<p>The best software to optimize an image for the web is <strong><a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a></strong>, but you can also do it for free with online tools like <strong><a href="https://pixlr.com/e/">Pixlr</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Images must be saved in the <strong>correct dimensions</strong>; it is useless to have a 5000x5000 image. Exceeding 1920 px in width is almost always unnecessary, so make sure to load images in the correct and <strong>lightest possible format</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="formats">Formats</h3>
<p>Use only two types of formats: <strong>JPG and PNG</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong> should only be used when the image has <strong>transparencies</strong>, for example, a logo.</p>
<p>For all <strong>photos</strong>, I recommend using <strong>JPG</strong> because it is lighter.</p>
<h2 id="be-careful-with-plugins">Be Careful with Plugins</h2>
<p>Plugins are very useful for a WordPress site, but you should <strong>never install them too lightly</strong>.</p>
<p>Before installing a new plugin, always check the <strong>update log</strong>, see if it is still <strong>maintained</strong> by the developers, and take a look at the <strong>reviews</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, it is important to <strong>always update them</strong> to the latest version.</p>
<p>Having too many poorly developed plugins causes <strong>huge problems</strong> for WordPress sites, both for <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>security</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="external-scripts">External Scripts</h2>
<p>Many times it is essential to include external scripts, such as Google Ads. However, these have a <strong>negative impact on performance</strong>. It is necessary to take this into account and <strong>optimize elsewhere if absolutely necessary</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Having a fast and efficient WordPress site is possible; you just need to develop it properly.</strong></p>
<p>The best solution is always to <strong>use a professionally developed theme from scratch</strong>, built based on the site&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p><strong>Generic themes</strong>, free or paid, are created to be used for various types of websites and therefore have many <strong>features that often prove useless</strong> and slow down the site.</p>
<p>The same goes for <strong>plugins</strong>. Where possible, it is always better to use a <strong>plugin developed from scratch</strong> specifically for the functionality it needs to perform.</p>
<p>The best solution for having a high-performance WordPress site is, therefore, to <strong>rely on a WordPress expert</strong> who can understand the site&rsquo;s needs and <strong>create the best solution</strong>. This ensures <strong>high performance</strong> and also a higher level of <strong>security</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Being online is essential today</strong>!</p>
<p>A <strong>website</strong> allows you to be <strong>easily found</strong> by everyone worldwide, creates a <strong>corporate image</strong>, enables <strong>fast communication</strong> with your customers, and much more&hellip; In short, it undoubtedly brings <strong>benefits</strong> to businesses <strong>of all types</strong>, whether large or small.</p>
<p><strong><em>But not all websites are the same!</em></strong></p>
<p>There are various <strong>types of websites</strong> (showcase, blog, e-commerce, etc.), but, above all, there are <strong>many technologies with which to build them.</strong></p>
<p>For the <strong>non-professionals</strong>, knowing how their website was created might not matter; what&rsquo;s important is that it works! <strong>But knowing a bit more can make a big difference.</strong></p>
<p><em>When building a house, we always ensure that the best materials are used!</em></p>
<p>This should also be the case for websites. It&rsquo;s good to rely on experts in the field, web developers, or web agencies, but <strong>it&rsquo;s better not to blindly trust</strong> and insist on understanding how the project will be executed.</p>
<p>For example, much is said about <strong>WordPress</strong>, a fantastic platform (this site is built on WordPress) when used correctly, but it&rsquo;s not the only or always the best option.</p>
<h2 id="wordpress-yes-but-how-is-it-used">WordPress, yes, but how is it used?</h2>
<p>WordPress is the <strong>most widely used platform worldwide</strong> for website development. It allows for very good results with a low time investment, thus <strong>lower costs</strong> compared to other solutions.</p>
<p><strong><em>But there&rsquo;s a right and wrong way to use it.</em></strong></p>
<p>WordPress is so widespread that there are <strong>thousands of free and paid themes</strong> to create a website, and developers often take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Selling a WordPress site for €2,000 &ldquo;developed&rdquo; by purchasing a €50 theme and slightly configuring it is borderline fraud&hellip; Yet it happens, and quite often.</p>
<p>For this reason, it&rsquo;s <strong>better to investigate a bit</strong> about what you&rsquo;re having built, ask questions, and be persistent in knowing how the final product will be realized.</p>
<p>Personally, when I choose to use WordPress, I <strong>develop the theme and plugins dedicated to the project entirely from scratch</strong>. This allows for having a <strong>unique, performant, and secure</strong> site without significantly impacting the final cost. An experienced developer, with the right skills, can create a complete WordPress theme from scratch in a few weeks, not more.</p>
<p>In addition to this site you are reading, I can give you the example of <strong><a href="http://bikeitalia.it/">Bikeitalia.it</a></strong>, a truly enormous site, with peaks of <strong>users exceeding 4,000 at the same time.</strong> Well, that site is based on <strong>WordPress</strong>, but the theme was <strong>built from scratch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, WordPress is not bad at all, provided it&rsquo;s used correctly.</strong> This will prevent unpleasant surprises like performance drops or, worse, security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
<p>Today there are also many <strong>Javascript frameworks</strong> that allow for creating modern, <strong>lightweight, and very fast websites!</strong></p>
<p>You can use React, Angular, or Vue, or even <strong>Gatsby</strong>, a framework based on React that allows for creating beautiful websites in a short time. In this case, however, the <strong>content management will be completely different, often more complicated.</strong></p>
<p>But if you want to <strong>focus on performance</strong>, this is undoubtedly the best choice.</p>
<h2 id="proprietary-cms">Proprietary CMS</h2>
<p>A third option is proprietary CMS. Many web agencies and developers <strong>have their own website creation systems.</strong></p>
<p>These can be <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong> solutions, depending on the developers. In any case, <strong>since they are developed from scratch, they usually allow for maximum configuration.</strong></p>
<p>You can do whatever you want without having to adhere to the laws of CMS and frameworks.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s necessary to <strong>ensure that these frameworks are up-to-date</strong>, not stuck in the past.</p>
<p>Here are some <strong>tips</strong> to understand if they are up to today&rsquo;s standards:</p>
<h3 id="seo-friendly-urls">SEO-Friendly URLs</h3>
<p>If the <strong>page URL ends with &ldquo;.php&rdquo;, &ldquo;.asp&rdquo;, &ldquo;.html&rdquo;</strong>, or something similar, it means that there is no real routing system on the site, and this does not allow for good URLs, which are more appreciated by Google.</p>
<p><strong>Good URL example</strong>: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.yoursite.com/contact/%22">http://www.yoursite.com/contact/&quot;</a></p>
<p><strong>Not-so-good URL example</strong>: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.yoursite.com/contact.asp%22">http://www.yoursite.com/contact.asp&quot;</a></p>
<h3 id="indices-in-urls">Indices in URLs</h3>
<p>If you see codes and mathematical symbols in the URL, <strong>the security of the site may be at risk</strong>. Many systems &ldquo;pass&rdquo; database indices in the URL, but this can be <strong>used by hackers for a direct attack on the database.</strong> So, if you see a URL like &ldquo;<a href="http://www.yoursite.com/article.php?id=45%22">http://www.yoursite.com/article.php?id=45&quot;</a>, then the system is <strong>not very secure.</strong></p>
<h2 id="404-errors">404 Errors</h2>
<p>Another characteristic of systems developed from scratch is that they often don&rsquo;t have a <strong>management for errors</strong>, such as the classic 404 Page Not Found. To find out, simply go to a site and enter random text after the domain, for example, &ldquo;<a href="http://yoursite.com/goodbye%22">http://yoursite.com/goodbye&quot;</a>. If there is a 404 page in the site, great, if you see the server error on a blank and ugly page, then it&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>
<p>All these little things can <strong>make your efforts to create a functional website fail</strong>, affecting <strong>Google indexing</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>security</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="orange-cms">Orange CMS</h2>
<p>An example of a proprietary CMS is <strong><a href="/orange">Orange CMS</a></strong>, my solution developed entirely from scratch.</p>
<p>If you want, <strong><a href="/orange">you can take a look</a></strong>, enter the backend, and <strong>create and view articles and pages.</strong> I have already used it for many sites, and the results have always been very good, superior to WordPress in terms of <strong>performance</strong>, but it all depends on the features you</p>
<p>want.</p>
<p>I hope this article has helped you <strong>understand how to approach the creation of your new website.</strong> Remember that the choice of technology is crucial, and <strong>you will carry it with you for a long time</strong>, so it must be done with method and professionalism.</p>

			<description>Development on Linux I have been developing software and websites for more than ten years now (with a break in between), and I have had the opportunity to use both Windows and Mac as well as Linux.

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="development-on-linux">Development on Linux</h1>
<p>I have been developing software and websites for more than ten years now (with a break in between), and I have had the opportunity to use both <a href="/blog/miglior-pc-per-sviluppatori-la-mia-esperienza/"><strong>Windows</strong></a> and <strong>Mac</strong> as well as <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>
<p>While I have primarily used <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Mac</strong>, during the last period where I worked closely with <strong>system administrators</strong> and did much more <strong>backend development</strong> than frontend, I felt the need to switch to something more <strong>performance-oriented</strong> for these activities.</p>
<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
<p>I started my career as a <strong>.NET developer.</strong> I used a PC with the marvelous <strong>Windows XP</strong>.</p>
<p>It truly was wonderful—<strong>stable</strong>, fast, capable of doing everything.</p>
<p>At that time, I used Visual Studio and developed <strong>management and CRM</strong> software for the <strong>Windows</strong> platform, so I was obliged to remain in the <strong>Microsoft</strong> environment.</p>
<p>Then I started developing some <strong>websites</strong>, always for the same company. Being proficient in .NET, we began developing with <strong>ASP</strong>, a language very similar to Visual Basic.</p>
<p>I remember that at the time, <strong>changing the operating system never even crossed my mind.</strong> Linux was still quite challenging, Mac was expensive, and neither allowed for developing software for Windows, so the matter ended there.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-mac">My first Mac</h2>
<p>With the first money I saved, I decided to buy my first Mac: a <strong>MacBook White</strong>.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by the Apple environment.</p>
<p>I made the purchase mainly to use it for <strong>recording music</strong>; I had no intention of using it for development.</p>
<p>I tried it at the beginning, but everything I was used to using didn&rsquo;t exist for Mac. Visual Studio wasn&rsquo;t available for Mac, and our sites ran on Windows servers, so there was nothing to be done.</p>
<p>I contented myself with the fantastic <strong>artistic department</strong> of the bitten apple. There was no comparison; drawing, video, and music software were decidedly on another level.</p>
<h2 id="a-period-of-pause">A period of pause</h2>
<p><strong>Then I stopped programming for a few years.</strong> I did something completely different; I graduated in a humanities subject and completely disconnected from computers.</p>
<p>I continued to use the <strong>Mac as a personal laptop</strong>, but I only used it for <strong>university</strong> and <strong>free time</strong>, and here I began to <strong>miss Windows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Office suite</strong>, the possibility of finding thousands of software for any type of problem, <strong>games</strong>, and much more were missing on the Mac&hellip;</p>
<p>So when the MacBook White finally died of old age (7 years of good service), <strong>I bought a Windows laptop.</strong></p>
<h2 id="return-to-windows">Return to Windows</h2>
<p>When I bought my current laptop, <strong>I was still studying</strong> and had not yet resumed my career as a developer, but <strong>I wanted to return to programming,</strong> to write some code, to develop something from scratch.</p>
<p>So I went to Unieuro and bought <strong>the laptop with the best value for money.</strong></p>
<h2 id="resuming-development">Resuming development</h2>
<p><strong>A year later, I started developing seriously again,</strong> and I felt great on <strong>Windows</strong>; after all, that&rsquo;s where I had started, and I felt at home.</p>
<p>Thanks to <strong>XAMPP</strong>, I could set up my own lamp stack in 5 minutes and start tinkering with <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>, and create my projects the way I prefer: using <strong>core PHP</strong>.</p>
<p>As I caught up with the times and learned to use the new tools, I increasingly realized that <strong>Windows was no longer the ideal choice for me.</strong></p>
<p>I was no longer creating management software but web applications, and <strong>the web runs on Linux.</strong></p>
<p>I started using <strong>Node.js</strong> and various <strong>JavaScript</strong> tools that work from the command line, and gradually, I began to discover how <strong>limiting PowerShell</strong> could be&hellip;</p>
<p>Then I expanded my skills as a backend developer, and here I had to make the leap to a <strong>more performant terminal</strong>, and that&rsquo;s when I discovered Linux.</p>
<p>I started using <strong>WSL</strong>, but it was all a bit <strong>too messy</strong> for my taste, so I switched to Linux proper.</p>
<h2 id="arrival-at-linux">Arrival at Linux</h2>
<p><strong>It wasn&rsquo;t love at first sight.</strong></p>
<p>I started installing Ubuntu as a virtual machine with <strong>VirtualBox</strong> to try to tinker a bit with the penguin.</p>
<p>The <strong>first impact</strong>, perhaps also due to a lifetime spent on other systems, was <strong>quite tragic</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>Everything I wanted to do, I had to <strong>configure</strong>; there was very little that worked right away, and for a while, I abandoned the idea of Linux.</p>
<p>Then little by little, I <strong>reapproached it</strong>, trying to <strong>adapt my way of thinking to this system</strong>, and everything changed.</p>
<p>The trick is to <strong>stop wanting Linux to resemble Windows or Mac OS,</strong> but to try to understand what it really is; then you can appreciate its infinite qualities.</p>
<p>Installing libraries, managing components, using command-line software, <strong>everything is much easier on Linux</strong>, everything works on the first try.</p>
<p>Configuring Vagrant correctly on Windows took much more time than on Ubuntu, and so much more.</p>
<p>Most of the time, all you need to do is <strong>run a command from the terminal, and voilà</strong>, everything works perfectly.</p>
<p>As a developer from now on, I think I will only use Linux distros, leaving a partition with Windows in case I have to do specific work with Photoshop (currently happily replaced with Pixlr) or other software available only for Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being better from a developer&rsquo;s perspective, there is also the whole issue of <strong>open source</strong> behind it, the largest community project in history, the <strong>opposition to multinational corporations</strong>, the <strong>fight against planned obsolescence of laptops</strong>, and much more, but this is not the time to address these issues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a developer, I would suggest that anyone <strong>switch to Linux</strong> (except those developing for iOS or specifically for Windows). Certainly, <strong>the beginning is not easy</strong>; you need to tinker a bit, bump your head a few times, but once you get into the right <strong>mood</strong>, everything flows smoothly and quickly.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m getting along very well with <strong><a href="https://www.ubuntu-it.org/">Ubuntu</a></strong> because I like <strong>Gnome</strong>. I tried other distros, but in the end, there isn&rsquo;t much difference; everything can be installed on any distro. So I went for Ubuntu for its <strong>stability</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been using it as a <strong>primary system for a couple of months</strong> now, and I think it will remain so for a long time. This way, I can <strong>finally free myself from Apple&rsquo;s pressing marketing</strong>, which, to be honest, is a constant temptation but would end up making me a slave to the apple&hellip; You know that if you buy a Mac, you want an iPhone, then an iPad, and an Apple Watch, and in the end, you always use the same three apps&hellip;</p>
<p>Even <strong>Windows laptops</strong> are becoming increasingly <strong>beautiful</strong> and tempting, with hardware that seems to age faster and faster. Of course, if you put an i7 in an ultrabook without a cooling system, you either melt the PC or castrate it and turn it into an i3. In the end, it&rsquo;s all marketing&hellip;</p>
<p>With <strong>Linux</strong>, on the other hand, you can take an <strong>i5</strong> from any generation, throw in an **SSD</p>
<p>** and <strong>8GB</strong> of RAM, and you&rsquo;re good for years without performance issues and more.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s the problem of <strong>battery life</strong>, which is not as well optimized on Linux&hellip; But in the end, I use <strong>Linux for work</strong>, connected to the power, and when I want to chill on the couch, I can use Windows and enjoy a few more hours away from the cables.</p>

			<title>CMS, Framework or Core Language?</title>
			<link>https://albertoreineri.it/en/blog/cms-framework-or-core-language/</link>

			<description>CMS, Framework, Core Language… Nowadays, when approaching a new project, we have the opportunity to use highly advanced tools that allow us to speed up and facilitate the work.
CMS systems are increasingly successful; it is said that half of the world&amp;rsquo;s websites are created with WordPress (although this data changes frequently&amp;hellip;). Frameworks are also thriving today, becoming more advanced and sophisticated.
And what about good old handwritten code? Does it still exist?</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CMS, Framework, Core Language… Nowadays, when approaching a new project, we have the opportunity to use highly advanced tools that allow us to speed up and facilitate the work.</p>
<p><strong>CMS</strong> systems are increasingly successful; it is said that half of the world&rsquo;s websites are created with WordPress (although this data changes frequently&hellip;). <strong>Frameworks</strong> are also thriving today, becoming more advanced and sophisticated.</p>
<p>And what about good old <strong>handwritten code</strong>? Does it still exist?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go step by step. I will try to analyze each of these three options, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, and finally, I will share my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="1-cms">1. CMS</h2>
<p><strong>Content Management Systems (CMS)</strong> allow managing a site&rsquo;s content without having programming knowledge. In practice, they offer an interface to write articles and pages almost as if you were using Word. The CMS translates this page into <strong>HTML</strong> so that it can be viewed by a browser.</p>
<p>Modern CMS, especially <strong><a href="https://en.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a></strong>, can greatly speed up website creation. There are even <strong>plugins</strong> to create the site&rsquo;s graphics without writing a single line of HTML.</p>
<p>They are the perfect solution for <strong>creating blogs</strong> (the reason they were created), but they can also be used for showcase sites, landing pages, and <strong>low-budget</strong> projects.</p>
<p>They boast a <strong>huge number of plugins</strong>, simplifying developers&rsquo; lives by providing pre-packaged services to configure.</p>
<p>On the downside, they may carry a lot of <strong>not always useful dependencies</strong>. Especially when using <strong>plugins, you need to be very careful</strong>; otherwise, you may make the page very heavy and significantly <strong>slow down</strong> the site&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p><em>Personally, I&rsquo;m not a big fan of CMS, but I recognize that if used for the purpose for which they were created, they are fantastic. For a blog, in my opinion, there is no better solution. Creating a theme from scratch is not very difficult, and you can quickly build an updatable platform.</em></p>
<h2 id="2-framework">2. Framework</h2>
<p>Frameworks are very different from CMS and should never be compared. <strong>If a CMS delivers ready-made solutions, a framework just sets the table.</strong></p>
<p>Frameworks <strong>offer a series of libraries</strong> that speed up project development but <strong>do not replace the programmer&rsquo;s work</strong>. To use a framework, <strong>in-depth knowledge</strong> of the language it is written in is required.</p>
<p>This is an excellent solution for <strong>medium/large projects</strong>. All frameworks offer a <strong>well-organized working environment</strong>, reducing the chance of writing bad code and increasing the speed at which code is written.</p>
<p>They also <strong>manage many security issues</strong>, removing them from the developer&rsquo;s mind, who can focus solely on project development.</p>
<p>I personally really like <strong>Laravel</strong>. Fast, secure, and tidy. Plus, it&rsquo;s written in PHP, which is the language I use the most at the moment.</p>
<p>In the near future, however, I plan to thoroughly study <strong>Django</strong>, which seems to be doing great and is much faster than Laravel, but we&rsquo;ll see what the future holds&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="3-pure-language">3. Pure Language</h2>
<p>A third way to develop your projects online is to <strong>build everything from scratch.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it may seem <strong>stupid</strong> to start from scratch when the above tools already exist, <strong>but it can have its advantages.</strong></p>
<p>If a developer knows a language <strong>very well</strong>, they can <strong>build their own framework and personal CMS.</strong> This is not about &ldquo;reinventing the wheel&rdquo; every time, but doing it only once and reusing it later. Of course, <strong>this has its disadvantages in terms of security and scalability, but it also has many advantages, especially speed.</strong></p>
<p>Well-written core PHP is much faster than Laravel.</p>
<p>Certainly, in this way, you will need to handle all the problems yourself, without thinking that there is already a ready-made program. But a developer is still a developer, and this is his job.</p>
<p>Time and budget are always a problem, which is why the pure language is often disparaged in favor of CMS or frameworks, but where possible, it can also be a solution.</p>
<h2 id="my-opinion">MY OPINION</h2>
<p>Among CMS, Framework, and Core language, I use all three methods. Over the years, I created my own framework and personal CMS, allowing me to <strong>manage projects 100%</strong>, <strong>customizing every tiny part of the back-end, front-end, and UX very quickly.</strong> Certainly, <strong>it took some time</strong> to create them, and it takes time from time to time to update them and keep up with the times, but this way, I can handle everything I do, <strong>I am the real &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of my project.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it is simpler to use a CMS or a framework, <strong>depending on the type of project you want to create.</strong></p>
<p>In terms of <strong>speed</strong>, if you write good code, nothing beats the <strong>core language</strong>. In terms of <strong>scalability</strong>, if many people work on the same project, if a high level of security is required, and if complicated database relationships need to be managed, then a good solution may be to use a <strong>framework</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, for a <strong>blog</strong> or for simple sites with a low budget, a <strong>CMS</strong> can be used, which will surely be slower than the previous solutions but will take care of many problems, removing a burden from the developer.</p>
<p>This is what I have noticed using these tools. What do you think? Are you a huge fan of WordPress and therefore snub the other options, or do you still write code?</p>
<p>How do you choose between CMS, Framework, and core language?</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>Happy coding to everyone!</p>

			<title>Gulp.js in WordPress Theme</title>

			<description>For some time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on fairly large projects, and it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to manage everything without getting lost in the thousands of files and folders within the project.
Code organization is a fundamental part of software development, be it web, desktop, or mobile.
Fortunately, today we can use tools that help us in the development and project management process.
One of these tools is Gulp.js!

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some time, I&rsquo;ve been working on <strong>fairly large projects</strong>, and it&rsquo;s not always easy to manage everything without getting lost in the <strong>thousands of files and folders</strong> within the project.</p>
<p><strong>Code organization</strong> is a fundamental part of software development, be it web, desktop, or mobile.</p>
<p>Fortunately, today we can use tools that help us in the <strong>development and project management process</strong>.</p>
<p>One of these tools is <strong>Gulp.js!</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-is-gulpjs">What is Gulp.js</h2>
<p>Gulp is a <strong>task runner</strong>, a program that allows you to <strong>automate a series of repetitive and constant tasks</strong>, such as minifying CSS and JS code, refreshing on every save, synchronizing web pages, optimizing images, and much more.</p>
<p><em><strong>To simplify</strong></em>, once Gulp is correctly set up within my project, every time I save a file, Gulp automatically checks the operation just performed (saving) and acts accordingly. In this case, it refreshes the browser.</p>
<p>If I modify a CSS file, on saving, Gulp will minify the file and refresh the browser!</p>
<p>Imagine a project that takes months to develop; being able to avoid <strong>refreshing the browser every time</strong>, compiling SASS files, optimizing images, etc., allows developers to <strong>save a lot of time</strong> or, at the very least, focus on something other than mundane and repetitive actions!</p>
<h2 id="gulp-and-wordpress">Gulp and WordPress</h2>
<p>The beauty of Gulp is that it can be used in <strong>any type of project</strong>, even during the development of a <strong>theme</strong> or <strong>plugin</strong> for <strong>WordPress</strong>, greatly <strong>speeding up</strong> programming times!</p>
<p>If you want to install and <strong>start using</strong> Gulp, I recommend this article: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/">https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/</a>. That&rsquo;s where I started!</p>
<h2 id="my-gulp-for-wordpress">My Gulp for WordPress!</h2>
<p>If you want a <strong>starting point</strong> to configure <strong>Gulp</strong> in your project, you can look on <a href="https://github.com/albertoreineri/">my GitHub profile</a>. I have included <a href="https://github.com/albertoreineri/gulp-for-wordpress">my file</a> for <strong>basic Gulp configuration in WordPress.</strong></p>
<p>In my latest project using <strong>Gulp</strong>, I automated the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refresh on every modification of any file</li>
<li>Optimize <strong>images</strong></li>
<li>Combine all <strong>SCSS</strong> files into one, compile it, and minify it</li>
<li>Combine all <strong>JS</strong> files into one and minify it</li>
</ul>
<p>To use <strong>Gulp</strong>, you need to split the folder with the site&rsquo;s resources. One will be the development folder, aptly named &ldquo;<strong>src</strong>&rdquo;, and the other will be the one that will be published, called &ldquo;<strong>assets</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On GitHub, you can find my configuration file to handle <strong>Gulp tasks within a WordPress theme.</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>get started</strong>, you just need to copy my gulpfile.js into your theme and run this command from the CLI:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-imagemin gulp-uglify gulp-sass browser-sync del gulp-concat gulp-clean
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now all you have to do is <strong>modify line 3</strong> of the file by entering the path to your WordPress project.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve encouraged you to <strong>use this tool.</strong> Although it&rsquo;s a bit complicated to set up, I&rsquo;m sure that once you&rsquo;ve understood it thoroughly, you <strong>won&rsquo;t be able to do without it!</strong></p>
<p>Let me know what you think in the <strong>comments</strong>, and <strong>happy coding!</strong></p>

			<description>Today, &amp;ldquo;from scratch&amp;rdquo; development is becoming less common. Lower budgets and tighter timelines have forced most developers to start from an existing foundation when creating their projects.
I still personally love developing &amp;ldquo;from scratch,&amp;rdquo; but living in today&amp;rsquo;s world and unable to spend nights writing code, I had to adapt to the current environment and start using some frameworks myself.
For some, these may be simple tips, but many times when faced with the choice between angular, vue, react, or laravel or codeigniter, the decision can be challenging.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; development is becoming less common. Lower budgets and tighter timelines have forced most developers to start from an existing foundation when creating their projects.</p>
<p>I still personally love developing &ldquo;from scratch,&rdquo; but living in today&rsquo;s world and unable to spend nights writing code, I had to adapt to the current environment and start using some frameworks myself.</p>
<p>For some, these may be simple tips, but many times when faced with the choice between <a href="https://angular.io/">angular</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>, or <a href="https://laravel.com/">laravel</a> or <a href="https://codeigniter.com/">codeigniter</a>, the decision can be challenging.</p>
<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<p>Before delving into the various points of the article, I&rsquo;d like to remind you of a general maxim: <strong>you cannot use a framework well without knowing the language in which it is written.</strong></p>
<p>You cannot use Bootstrap well without knowing CSS, Laravel without knowing PHP, or React without knowing JavaScript. In this profession, having solid foundations truly makes a difference between copying code from Stack Overflow and writing it knowing exactly what you are doing, why, and the general repercussions on the project.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-a-framework">What is the purpose of a framework?</h2>
<p>The first and most obvious question should be: &ldquo;<strong>What should the framework do?</strong>&rdquo; Unfortunately, this question is often ignored.</p>
<p>Using a <strong>framework created to fulfill a specific purpose</strong> is simpler than adapting another one to our needs. Using jQuery to manipulate data structures is certainly not the best choice. Therefore, you must have a clear goal in mind to make the right choice.</p>
<h2 id="4-characteristics-to-choose-a-framework">4 characteristics to choose a framework</h2>
<p>I want to highlight <strong>4 important characteristics</strong> to keep in mind when choosing a new framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Properties and technical features</li>
<li>Community involvement</li>
<li>Consequences of the choice</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>the four keys</strong> to make a good choice.</p>
<p>Of course, there are <strong>advantages and disadvantages</strong> to each framework, but keeping these four points in mind can help make a correct decision.</p>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p><em>In a constantly rushing world, time is crucial.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>time factor</strong> is crucial in choosing a framework. Why? Because without <strong>time to study, test, and develop it,</strong> it is useless to think of using it.</p>
<p>Often we have <strong>little time to deliver a project,</strong> and introducing a new framework will almost certainly cause delays. Therefore, in terms of planning ahead, we need to check the <strong>amount of code</strong> that this framework will make us write. Not just the <strong>actual time</strong> it will take to write it, but also <strong>how complex</strong> the code you and your team will have to write will be, as it will also cause a significant loss of time.</p>
<p>The level of complexity also affects how <strong>manageable</strong> it will be. So, <strong>the more code you write, the more difficult it becomes to support it later.</strong> Thus, more code leads to more errors.</p>
<p>I found this simple programming rule online: <em>e = mc² (errors = more code^2)</em></p>
<h3 id="properties-and-technical-features">Properties and technical features</h3>
<p>The choice of a framework can be influenced by <strong>technical aspects</strong>, community opinions, and what can be found in the framework&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p>Do not be deceived by what you read in forums. The best way to know if what is being talked about is real is simple: <strong>test it.</strong></p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, due to <strong>limited time</strong>, testing a framework might be a luxury we cannot afford. Therefore, try to <strong>extrapolate the most important technical feature</strong> from the available information.</p>
<p>Is the framework suitable for the structure of the project we have or want to implement? <strong>Using a framework designed for a specific task is easier than adapting one to our needs.</strong></p>
<p>Will it be better in terms of <strong>performance</strong>? There&rsquo;s no point in opting for a slow framework during development that will also be slow in execution.</p>
<p>If we are choosing a front-end framework, it is important to check <strong>browser compatibility.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, as I mentioned in the introduction to this article, you must <strong>know the basics:</strong> to be able to correctly choose a structure, you need to have the basics and requirements to fully understand it. When you choose a framework, you must <strong>know what you are talking about.</strong> By this, I mean you need to know the purpose of a framework. If you do not have basic knowledge, learning a framework will be useless as you will not be able to fully understand it.</p>
<p><em>If you are not prepared, learn the basics first.</em></p>
<h3 id="community-involvement">Community involvement</h3>
<p>What makes a framework worth considering? <strong>The people who use it.</strong> Okay, but how can we <strong>understand if a framework has an active community?</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>several factors</strong> that can help us understand the community involvement for a particular technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people talk about it on the web?</li>
<li>How many people continue to use it?</li>
<li>How often do developers respond to bug reports?</li>
<li>How many pull requests?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the questions that can give you some information about community involvement.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-a-crowded-framework">What are the advantages of a &ldquo;crowded&rdquo; framework?</h3>
<p>An active community considerably increases <strong>documentation</strong> on a particular technology, thus <strong>reducing the time</strong> required for research and learning.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the company you work for is growing, it will be much easier to <strong>find collaborators</strong> familiar with the framework due to its popularity.</p>
<p>However, not always an active community is enough to direct our choice. After ascertaining the existence of a good community, you need to check <strong>how many of these people</strong> (preferably large companies) <strong>actually use this technology in a production environment!</strong></p>
<p>Discovering who uses a particular technology is far from easy, but creators often <strong>mention the companies</strong> that use the framework and, in that case, check how they implement this technology and for what purpose.</p>
<p>Usually, development teams of these technologies release a <strong>roadmap on their future plans,</strong> so check what <strong>they have in mind.</strong></p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-the-choice">Consequences of the choice</h3>
<p>Before finalizing the choice, we should take a moment to think about the <strong>possible consequences</strong> of what choosing the new framework could entail in the development environment.</p>
<p>Remember that if you work <strong>in a team,</strong> it might be more difficult for others to learn a new framework. <strong>How much do you think they could take to get familiar with it</strong> and how much time do you think they can dedicate to learning it? Should they know something else before studying?</p>
<p><strong>The choice must be weighed and discussed</strong> multiple times to see especially what <strong>the team thinks</strong> about it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>There is no golden rule that guarantees a 100% right choice. Only practice and time will allow us to understand this.</p>
<p>In this article, I hope I managed to give you ideas to start facing your choice, <strong>but remember:</strong></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not about finding the best framework; it&rsquo;s about finding the</em> <strong>right</strong> <em>framework.</em></p>

			<description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see which free software we can use for web development.
Are you getting into the programming world and want to start developing some websites or a small web app? Congratulations! Welcome to the fantastic world of Web Development!
To start, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to install the necessary programs to write your first code and make what you&amp;rsquo;ve written &amp;ldquo;run.&amp;rdquo; In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll quickly go over the software you&amp;rsquo;ll need.</description>

<p>Are you getting into the programming world and want to start developing some websites or a small web app? Congratulations! Welcome to the fantastic world of Web Development!</p>
<p>To start, you&rsquo;ll need to install the necessary programs to write your first code and make what you&rsquo;ve written &ldquo;run.&rdquo; In this article, we&rsquo;ll quickly go over the software you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set aside the eternal debate about which operating system is better for a particular thing, the trends that lead to choosing one PC over another, and things like that. All the software mentioned in this article is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s see what we need to develop websites and web apps.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/243UeRVMtFI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="1-browser">1. BROWSER</h2>
<p>If we intend to do some web development, the fundamental software we need is a browser. All operating systems come with a pre-installed browser, but my recommendation is to use <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a>. This browser is very fast and offers a set of very useful <strong>developer tools</strong>.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dwell on this point because you&rsquo;re probably already using Chrome or know perfectly well what it is. Let&rsquo;s move on and see other free software for web development.</p>
<h2 id="2-text-editor">2. TEXT EDITOR</h2>
<p>To do web development, you need to write code, and to write code, you need a text editor. It&rsquo;s possible to write code even with Notepad, but it&rsquo;s certainly not an optimal solution.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, a fantastic free software from Microsoft!</p>
<p>Rich in features and extensions, it allows you to manage projects very well, also thanks to the internal <strong>terminal</strong> in the interface.</p>
<p>This is definitely the essential program for any programmer.</p>
<h2 id="3-local-server">3. LOCAL SERVER</h2>
<p>To &ldquo;make&rdquo; our projects run on our computer, it&rsquo;s necessary to install a local server to make them work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a> for years, also free software that includes <strong>MySQL</strong>. Incredibly useful and easy to use, it allows you to configure a local server and start your project in <strong>PHP</strong> in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Essential for creating sites in <strong>WordPress</strong>, for projects in PHP frameworks like <strong>Laravel</strong> or <strong>CodeIgniter</strong>, or even for work in <strong>Core PHP</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="4-ftp-client">4. FTP CLIENT</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve finished our site, we need to <strong>upload it online</strong>!</p>
<p>To do this, you can use an <strong>FTP Client</strong> that allows you to <strong>connect to the hosting</strong> and upload the site&rsquo;s files.</p>
<p>The most commonly used software for this task is definitely <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. Free, simple, and intuitive, it&rsquo;s the right choice for setting up your site easily, quickly, and efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="5-graphics">5. GRAPHICS</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s not forget that every project also has a graphic part!</p>
<p>To <strong>develop the layouts</strong> of your projects, I recommend using <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using this software for a while, and I&rsquo;m really satisfied, plus it&rsquo;s <strong>completely free</strong>! Just sign up with your Google account, and voilà! You can start creating fantastic web layouts and more!</p>
<p>All these software are <strong>free</strong> and <strong>cross-platform</strong>, except for the next one, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>, a fabulous Adobe software that allows you to do everything you want with photos and images. Although many of these things can also be done with Figma, <strong>I still can&rsquo;t completely detach myself from this software</strong>, which remains the only paid one in my setup&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to try a valid alternative, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, which they say should be very powerful. Unfortunately, having started with Photoshop and knowing it quite well by now, I don&rsquo;t feel like starting from scratch to learn a new program&hellip; I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to judge!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s <strong>all you need</strong>! Now you can start getting creative with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/546eUw3PsRI1HUGbBUeghC">code and design</a> and create your first projects!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this article.</p>
<p><em>Happy coding!</em></p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WordPress is one of the most widely used platforms in the world for creating websites, but sometimes it can be easy to encounter a virus. But how can they be removed?</p>
<p>WordPress allows anyone to set up a functioning website in very little time and with very low costs.</p>
<p>However, this also means having many websites created by non-professionals who install themes and plugins randomly without really knowing what they are doing. As long as the site is small and has a small number of users, there&rsquo;s no problem. However, when it reaches a larger audience, the probability of being targeted by hackers becomes higher.</p>
<p>It is estimated that at least 30% of WordPress websites have vulnerabilities. Considering that more than 75 million websites use this platform, the vulnerabilities are numerous.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now see how to keep your WordPress site secure and how to eliminate any viruses.</p>
<h2 id="securing-wordpress">Securing WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress uses a very intelligent system of themes and plugins, but it is necessary to be careful about what is installed.</p>
<p>There are some fundamental rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check the source of themes and plugins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Install as few plugins as possible</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have good hosting</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-check-the-source-of-themes-and-plugins">1. Check the Source of Themes and Plugins</h3>
<p>Every time something is installed on a WordPress site, code is added to the project. If the code is well written, it will bring useful functionality and improve the site. However, if it is poorly written or contains bugs, it can cause many problems.</p>
<p>When installing something on WordPress, it is crucial to pay very close attention to the source.</p>
<p><strong>NEVER</strong> install plugins or themes downloaded from unclear sources.</p>
<p>The best thing is to stick to the official WordPress repository or trusted large stores.</p>
<h3 id="2-install-as-few-plugins-as-possible">2. Install as Few Plugins as Possible</h3>
<p>There are plugins for everything nowadays, but each plugin is an additional object to manage and maintain.</p>
<p>Having plugins specific to almost useless functionalities risks bringing vulnerabilities to the system and unnecessarily burdening the site.</p>
<p>Installing 20 plugins managed by different developers significantly increases the risk of attacks. If one of these developers does not fix a bug or a vulnerability is discovered, the entire site is at risk.</p>
<p><strong>The trick is this: &ldquo;Few but good.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h3 id="3-have-good-hosting">3. Have Good Hosting</h3>
<p>We are talking about hosting and not a server because the vast majority of websites are hosted on shared hosting. These services have improved a lot and offer services that were previously available only on dedicated servers, such as SSH access, caching, and security.</p>
<p>Being able to rely on a good service is very important to protect against attacks and manage them in the unfortunate event of an infection.</p>
<h2 id="removing-a-virus-from-a-wordpress-site">Removing a Virus from a WordPress Site</h2>
<p>There is no single way to remove a virus because they act very differently from each other.</p>
<p>This complicates things a little&hellip; So, it is difficult to explain how to remove a virus in a simple article, but I will try to indicate some ways to manage the problem.</p>
<h3 id="1-look-for-backups-before-the-attack">1. Look for Backups Before the Attack</h3>
<p>If you have good hosting, you will certainly have daily or at least weekly backups. The first thing to do is download one of these backups and keep it aside to have a &ldquo;pre-virus&rdquo; situation.</p>
<p>If the site is static, without updatable sections like a blog or portfolio, you can simply restore the backup to the pre-attack version, and the job is done.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the site has undergone updates that you do not want to lose, it is advisable to keep a pre-virus copy for safety and go look for infected files.</p>
<h3 id="2-scan-the-website-with-online-tools">2. Scan the Website with Online Tools</h3>
<p>There are many online tools capable of analyzing the site and identifying critical issues.</p>
<p>You can also use some plugins developed to manage security, such as WordFence or Sucuri, and use their scan to analyze all files on the site.</p>
<p>These do not guarantee a 100% optimal result, but it is still a good starting point.</p>
<p>Here are some useful links for scanning:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wpsec.com/">WPsec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/">Sucuri SiteCheck</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackertarget.com/wordpress-security-scan/">HackerTarget WordPress Security Scan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wprecon.com/">WPrecon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://firstsiteguide.com/tools/free-fsg/wordpress-security-online-scanner/">FirstSiteGuide WordPress Security Online Scanner</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are comfortable with the CLI, you can also use <a href="https://wpscan.org/">WP Scan</a>, the software par excellence for testing the security of a WordPress site.</p>
<h3 id="disable-themes-and-plugins">Disable Themes and Plugins</h3>
<p>To try to isolate the virus, it can be useful to proceed with disabling themes and plugins.</p>
<p>If the site works without plugins and with the default WordPress theme, you can reactivate them one by one and figure out where the infection is.</p>
<h3 id="copy-original-theme-and-plugin-files">Copy Original Theme and Plugin Files</h3>
<p><strong>CAUTION!!!</strong> Be very careful when implementing this point. If you are not experienced, you could do more damage than what is already present! If a theme or a plugin has been infected, one solution to remove the virus from the WordPress site is to overwrite the folders containing the theme and plugins with versions downloaded from official sources.</p>
<p>In this case, if the virus was present in the folder, it will be overwritten.</p>
<h3 id="analyze-wordpress-structure">Analyze WordPress Structure</h3>
<p>Lastly, you can <strong>analyze the file and folder structure of WordPress</strong> to check that there are no strange files not present in the original installation.</p>
<p>If strange files are found, they should be deleted, always paying close attention to what is being done.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are some generic steps to check the status of a website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>every virus is different</strong>, some act on the database, others directly on the system files, and still others in ways we cannot even imagine.</p>
<p>In this article, I have tried to give you <strong>some basic advice</strong> to try to remove a virus from WordPress. I hope this could be helpful to you!</p>

			<title>GIT! What is it???</title>

			<description>Git is fantastic version control software created by a pretty good programmer: Linus Torvalds.
WHO IS LINUS TORVALDS? For the few who don&amp;rsquo;t know who this person is (I hope they are really very few&amp;hellip;), he is the creator of Linux. If we consider that more than half of the web and the majority of smartphones operate thanks to code written by him, we all owe him gratitude for his genius and generosity.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Git</strong> is fantastic version control software created by a pretty good programmer: <strong>Linus Torvalds.</strong></p>
<h2 id="who-is-linus-torvalds">WHO IS LINUS TORVALDS?</h2>
<p>For the few who don&rsquo;t know who this person is (I hope they are really very few&hellip;), he is the creator of <strong>Linux</strong>. If we consider that more than half of the <strong>web</strong> and the majority of <strong>smartphones</strong> operate thanks to code written by him, we all <strong>owe him gratitude</strong> for his genius and generosity.</p>
<h2 id="but-lets-get-back-to-git">BUT LET&rsquo;S GET BACK TO GIT!</h2>
<p>There are thousands of articles about this software online, but truly understanding what it does for a <strong>newbie</strong> is not that simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to explain it easily and quickly.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-git">WHAT IS GIT?</h2>
<p>Git is software that allows you to <strong>track</strong> changes made to a project.</p>
<p>The simplest function is the one that allows you to <strong>go back</strong> to a previous version of the project you are working on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re implementing a feature, perhaps writing a couple of hours of code, but you realize you&rsquo;ve taken the wrong path. At this point, without version control software, you would have to hit <strong>ctrl+z</strong> indefinitely to find the exact point you want to return to. And what if, by chance, the cache of your IDE has stalled for some reason, and you find yourself stuck in a point where you can&rsquo;t go forward or backward?</p>
<p>Even if we were foresighted programmers and had created a backup folder for the software, we would still have to navigate through the file manager, find the folder, rename it, move and delete files, etc&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>With Git, you just enter a command</strong>, and your project magically returns to how it was before! Fantastic!</p>
<p>It is also possible to keep open <strong>different development paths</strong>, perhaps testing a feature from one base and another from the same base, and then decide which one is the best, all without creating thousands of folders and subfolders that will surely end up making everything very confusing.</p>
<p>With Git, it is also possible to <strong>upload our project online</strong>, on <strong>GitHub</strong>, a wonderful code-sharing platform.</p>
<p>This way, we can download our code from any computer anywhere in the world.</p>
<h2 id="git-for-small-projects">GIT FOR SMALL PROJECTS</h2>
<p>Certainly, Git was developed for very large projects, but it is such a <strong>fast and simple</strong> software (git in the US means <em>idiot</em>&hellip;) that it can also be used for small things, to keep track of our work, make small changes, or run tests. Furthermore, the ability to &ldquo;ship&rdquo; everything online is very useful in case we need to access the code from a new location!</p>
<h2 id="command-line">COMMAND LINE</h2>
<p>Git is software that works through the <strong>CLI</strong>, the command line.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with this tool, <strong>it&rsquo;s time to start</strong> getting used to it. <strong>Don&rsquo;t be scared</strong> by the absence of icons, graphics, and a mouse; in reality, it is much faster than the interfaces we have been accustomed to in recent years!</p>
<p>And you are a programmer, right? The mouse is more of an embellishment for the desk; <strong>the work is done with ten fingers on the keyboard</strong>!!!</p>
<p>There is also a Desktop version of the software, but the classic one works so well that I have never thought of testing it.</p>
<p>If you work on <strong>Windows</strong> (like me!!!), you can also download <strong>Git Bash</strong>, a very nice command line created to facilitate Git operations.</p>
<p>Soon, I will <a href="/blog/come-usare-git/">write a brief guide on basic Git commands</a>, so you can start using it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t be able to do without it anymore!</p>
<p><em>Happy coding! Bye!!!</em></p>
